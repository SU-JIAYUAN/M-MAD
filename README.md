# M-MAD: Multidimensional Multi-Agent Debate for Advanced Machine Translation Evaluation

## **ðŸ¤–** About M-MAD<a name="about"></a>

The **M-MAD** framework is a systematic LLM-based multi-agent framework for advanced LLM-as-a-judge MT evaluation. It operates in three stages:


1. **Dimension Partition**: Decomposing the heuristic MQM annotation guideline into distinct dimensions for independent LLM-as-a-judge assessments.
2. **Multi-Agent Debate**: conducting multi-agent debates within each dimension, harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge, reasoning, and collaborative abilities.
3. **Final Judgement**: synthesizing the debated outcomes through a final judge agent to produce a comprehensive evaluation judgment.

.h 预处理器文件; 通常不出现在命令行上其他后级名的文件被传递给连接器 (Linker).通常包括:	.h preprocessor files; files that do not normally appear on the command line with other post-names are passed to the linker.	no
.0 目标文件 (Object file)	.0 Object file	no
.a 归档库文件(Archive file)	.a Archive file (Archive file)	no
除非使用了 -cec，-s, 或 -E 选项(或者编译错误阻止了完整的过程),否则连接总是最后的步骤.	The connection is always the last step unless the -cec, -s, or -E option is used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process).	no
在连接阶段中,所有对应于源程序的.e 文件，-1 库文件, 无法识别的文件名(包括指定的.o H 标文件和 .a 库文件)按命令行中的顺序传递给连接器选项 (OPTIONS)	In the connection phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, unrecognized file names (including specified .o H tag files and .a library files) are passed to the connector options (OPTIONS) in the order they are in the command line.	no
选项必须分立给出 : de ' 完全不同于 `-d -r '.	Options must be given separately: de 'is completely different from' -d -r '.	no
大多数 ` -=E :和 `-W' 选项有两个相反的格式 : -fname 和 -fno-name (或 -Wname 和 -Wno- name).	Most of the '- = E: and' -W 'options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).	no
这里只列举不是默认选项的格式.	Only the formats that are not the default options are listed here.	no
下面是所有选项的摘要, 按类型分组, 解释放在后面的章节中.	Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, explained in the following chapters.	no
代码生成选项 (Code Generation Option)	Code Generation Option	yes
总体选项 (Overall Option)	Overall Option	yes
明确指出后面输入文件的语言为 language (而不是从文件名后绥得到的默认选择).	Make it clear that the language of the subsequent input file is language (rather than the default choice that follows the filename).	yes
这个选项应用于后面所有的输入文件, 直到遇着下一个 `-x' 选项 .language 的可选	This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next '-x' option is encountered.	yes
关闭任何对语种的明确说明, 因此依据文件名后级处理后面的文件 RE AS E ` -x' 选项).	Turn off any explicit specification of the language, thus depending on the filename after processing the subsequent file RE AS E '-x' option).	yes
如果只操作四个阶段( 预处理, 编译, 汇编, 连接)中的一部分, 可以使用 ` -x' 选项 (或文件名后 Ah) 告诉 geo 从哪里开始,用 `~-c' ，`-s' ,或 `-E' 选项告诉 geo 到哪里结束.注意,某些选项组合 (例如 ，`-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c 编译或汇编源文件, ETER. ERA ATI 缺省情况下， GCC 通过用 ` .o' 蔡换源文件名后级 ` .ec 标文件名. 可以使用-o 选项选择其他名字.GCC忽略 -ec 选项后面任何无法识别的输入文伯 -S F 何事情.	Note that some combinations of options (e.g., '-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF = c Compiling or compiling source files, ETER.ERA ATI By default, GCC can tell geo where to start by using the '-x' option (or Ah after the filename), and where to end by using the '~ -c', '-s', or '-E' option.	yes
了的目标文件.	The target document.	yes
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	After the compilation stops, no assembly is performed.	yes
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	Pipelines are used between different stages of the compilation process, as assemblers on those systems cannot read data from the pipeline, GNU's assemblers do not have this problem, and assemblers can accept C "dialects": support for C programs conforming to the ANSI standard.	yes
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This will disable some of the key features of GNU Cc that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, as well as features such as unix and vax, which indicate that the standard library is suitable and rarely used, and disable the use of the main function, which returns an int, typically for almost all programs except the kernel.	yes
对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	For function declarations without arguments, such as' int foo (); ', it is handled in a C style -- that is, the number or type of arguments is not specified. (C + + only).	no
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	Normally, such a function foo in C + + means that the argument is empty.	no
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	From here, the section list was cut to try to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.	no
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	For the NU c manual, we have removed the details so that when the content is out of date, people will not be HERI.	no
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	For C + + programs (not C), the '-traditional' option has an additional effect, allowing assignment to this.	no
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	It is the same as the result of the '-Ethis-is-variable' option.	no
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp tries to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.	no
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	In particular, the preprocessor is mentioned above, but not the other effects of the '-traditional' option.	no
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of '$' characters in identifiers (C + + only).	no
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	You can specify the -Efno-dollars-in-identifiers option to explicitly disallow the use of the '$' character.	no
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	(GNU C + + allows the '$' character on some target systems by default, but not on all systems.)	no
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	-fenum-int-equiv Allows an implicit conversion (MEF c + +) of ant types to enumeration types.	no
正常情况下 GNU C++ 允许从 enum 到 int 的转换,反之则不行.	Normally GNU C + + allows conversion from enum to int, not vice versa.	no
-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	For example: -fexternal- - templates generates smaller code (limited to c + +) for template declarations, by making only one copy of each template function where they are defined.	no
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	To successfully use this option, you must tag '# pragma implementatio' (definition) or '# Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use templates.	no
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	When a program is compiled with '-fexternal-templates', the template instances are all of the external type. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.	no
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	This can be achieved by typedef, which refers to each instance needed.	no
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	Correspondingly, if the default option '-fno-exteznal-templates' is used at compile time, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.	no
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All member functions (except for the constructor subfunction and the mnew or delete member operator) are considered virtual functions of the class they belong to.	no
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	This does not mean that every call to a member function will pass through the internal virtual function table.	no
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; this is the case.	no
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch Allows the type of the second and third arguments of a conditional expression to be mismatched.	no
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	The value of this expression is Void. -fthis- -is-variable Allows assignment to this (for c + + only).	no
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	After merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C + +, the assignable 'this' appears out of place.	no
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	So, by default, this assignment is not valid inside a class member function.	no
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	However, for backwards compatibility, you can use the '-fthis-is-variable' option to make this work.	no
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	-funsigned-char Defines char as an unsigned char.	no
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Various machines have their own default char type. It may be unsigned char or signed char.	no
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when it depends on the symbolic nature of the data.	no
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	But many programs have been written to use only simple char, and this is a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the machine on which the program is written).	no
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This option, and its anti-semantic options, make the program work on the corresponding default values.	no
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly the same as one of them.	no
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	If the 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifier is not explicitly declared, these options are used to define a bitfield or unsigned bit field.	no
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	By default, bit fields are signed because they inherit a primitive integer type such as int, which is a signed number; however, if the '-traditional' option is specified, bit fields are always unsigned.	no
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	-fwritable-strings Stores string constants to writable data segments, and does not treat them differently.	no
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	This is in order to be compatible with some old programs, they calculate string constants is a very bad idea, the '-traditional' option has the same effect.	no

与此同时，各国政府削减了与毒品相关的预算。	At the same time, Governments have cut drug-related budgets.	no
如果各国政府以同样的方式应对当前的经济衰退，预防吸毒和相关风险行为等干预措施和戒毒治疗服务可能会受到沉重打击。	Interventions such as the prevention of drug use and associated risk behaviours and drug treatment services could be hard hit if Governments responded in the same way to the current economic downturn.	no
此外，拦截行动和国际合作的优先性可能会降低，使贩运者更容易行动。	In addition, interdiction operations and international cooperation may be given lower priority, making it easier for traffickers to act.	no

有信使将甲基苯丙胺等合成毒品放在随身背包或藏在私人行李中携带，有时数量很大。由于几乎各地都对航空客运实施了限制，利用商业航空旅行供应毒品的活动可能会完全中断。	Synthetic drugs, such as methamphetamine, are carried by couriers in carry-on bags or hidden in private luggage, sometimes in large quantities, and the use of commercial air travel for the supply of drugs may be completely disrupted owing to restrictions on air travel in almost all regions.	no
尽管国际邮政供应链也受到了干扰，但利用暗网和货物邮寄进行贩运的活动可能会增加。	Despite disruptions to the international postal supply chain, trafficking through the dark web and the mailing of goods is likely to increase.	no
从长远来看，经济衰退和相关的封闭措施可能会打乱毒品市场。	In the long term, the economic downturn and related closure measures could disrupt the drug market.	no
由于不断上升的失业率和缺乏机会，贫困和弱势人群将更有可能以有害的方式吸毒，患上吸毒病症，并转向与毒品有关的非法活动一无论是生产还是运输。	As a result of rising unemployment and the lack of opportunities, the poor and vulnerable will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug use disorders and turn to illegal drug-related activities, whether production or transportation.	no
贩毒组织可能会利用这种情况，向脆弱人群提供服务，并招募新成员来壮大队伍。	Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation by providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to augment their ranks.	no

世界各地的吸毒现象一直在增多，无论是从总体数字还是从吸毒者在世界人口中所占比例来看都是如此。	Drug abuse has been increasing worldwide, both in terms of overall numbers and in terms of the proportion of people who use drugs in the world population.	no
2009年估计吸毒者有2.1亿人，占全球15-64岁人口的4.8%,而2018年估计吸毒者有2.69亿人，占这类人口的5.3%。	In 2009, there were an estimated 210 million drug users, representing 4.8 per cent of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018, there were an estimated 269 million drug users, representing 5.3 per cent of that population.	no
在过去二十年期间，发展中国家吸毒情况的增长速度远远快于发达国家。	During the past two decades, drug use in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.	no
这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。	This partly reflects the difference in overall population growth over the period, from 7 per cent in developed countries to 28 per cent in developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.	no
青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。	Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.	no
在2000-2018年期间，发展中国家这一年龄段的人口增长了16%,而发达国家这一年龄段的人口减少了10%。	During the period 2000-2018, the population of this age group increased by 16 per cent in developing countries, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10 per cent.	no
1城市化是当前和未来毒品市场的一个驱动因素	1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets	no
无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。	Drug use is higher in urban than in rural areas in both developed and developing countries.	no
吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。	The overall increase in drug use is due in part to the massive rural-urban migration, which currently accounts for more than half of the world & apos; s population living in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.	no
城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。	Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.	no
财富的增加与吸毒情况增多相联，但承受疾病负担最大的是最贫穷的人在世界范围内，发达国家的吸毒情况比发展中国家更为普遍。	The increase in wealth is associated with an increase in drug use, but the burden of disease is borne most by the poorest people worldwide, with drug use being more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.	no
可卡因之类的毒品更是与世界上较富裕的地区联系较为牢固。	Drugs such as cocaine have stronger links with the more affluent regions of the world.	no
同样，在各国内部，社会富裕阶层的吸毒流行率较高。	Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the wealthier segments of society.	no
但转为吸毒病症的比率较高的却是社会经济地位较低的人。	However, the rate of transition to drug use disorders is higher among persons of lower socio-economic status.	no
来自少数几个国家的数据表明，有害的吸毒模式与病症同低收入之间存在联系。	Data from a few countries indicate a link between harmful patterns of drug use and symptoms and low income.	no
这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。	These patterns appear to be less common in the more affluent segments of society.	no
全球新冠肺炎危机造成的经济制约很可能会加剧包括吸毒者在内的最弱势群体的风险。	The economic constraints resulting from the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable, including drug users.	no
例如，劳动力市场的变化，如失业率上升，过去一直与吸毒情况的增加有关，而这场疫情己经迫使全球数千万人失业。	For example, changes in the labour market, such as rising unemployment, had in the past been associated with an increase in drug use, and the epidemic had already forced tens of millions of people around the world to lose their jobs.	no
新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。	A pandemic that would lead to a further expansion of the drug market could lead to more farmers or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because the control capacity of State authorities is reduced or because more people may have to take the risk of engaging in illicit activities in the context of the economic crisis.	no
新冠肺炎的相关限制措施导致空中和陆路交通减少，海上贩运可能已经因此而增加，海上的拦截风险低，而且比空中或陆路走私的数量更多。	Constraints related to new coronary pneumonia have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, which may have increased trafficking by sea, with a lower risk of interception by sea and a higher volume of smuggling than by air or land.	no
最近已有报告称可卡因货物直接从南美经由海路运往欧洲。	There have recently been reports of cocaine consignments being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.	no
复杂性增强	Increased complexity	yes
非国际管制物质的出现情况稳定，但有潜在危害的新型类阿片正在增多毒品市场正日趋复杂。	The emergence of substances not under international control is stable, but potentially harmful new types of opioids are proliferating and the drug market is becoming increasingly complex.	yes
除大麻、可卡因和海洛因等植物类物质之外，已经增添了数百种合成毒品，其中许多并不在国际管制之下。药品的非医疗使用也快速增多。	In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control, and the non-medical use of drugs has also increased rapidly.	yes
会员国的国内市场每年约有500种新型活性物质。	There are approximately 500 new active substances on the domestic market of Member States each year.	yes
目前其中大多是兴奋剂，其次是合成的大麻素受体激动剂和少量的类阿片。	Most of them are now stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and small quantities of opioids.	yes
虽然新型精神活性物质的总体数量已经稳定下来，但比例发生了变化。	While the overall quantity of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.	yes
在2014年确定的新型精神活性物质种类总数中，类阿片新型精神活性物质仅占2%,但到2018年，这一数字己上升至9%。	New psychoactive substances for opioids accounted for only 2 per cent of the total number of new psychoactive substance types identified in 2014, but by 2018 that figure had risen to 9 per cent.	yes
类阿片新型精神活性物质中有许多是芬太尼的类似物，其药效和危害已得到证明，在北美导致了过量死亡事件，其他区域也有，但程度较轻。	Many of the new psychoactive substances in opioids are analogues of fentanyl, and their efficacy and harm have been demonstrated to cause excess deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, in other regions.	yes
在北美，芬太尼有的用作海洛因和其他毒品（包括可卡因和甲基苯丙胺）的掺杂剂，有的用来制造假冒的药用类阿片。	In North America, fentanyl is used either as an adulterant in heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, or in the manufacture of counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.	yes
一些证据表明，欧洲也有注射新型精神活性物质兴奋剂的现象：一项对欧洲六个城市废弃注射器残留物的研宄发现，许多注射器都沾有产生兴奋作用的新型精神活性物质》	There is some evidence that new psychoactive substance stimulants are also injected in Europe: a study of remnants of discarded syringes in six European cities found that many of the syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances with stimulating effects. & quot;	yes
2新型精神活性物质的使用可能会逐渐牢固存在于弱势群体中	2 The use of new psychoactive substances may become increasingly entrenched among vulnerable groups	no
单一种类的新型精神活性物质几乎从未形成大的市场。	A single class of new psychoactive substances has almost never created a large market.	no
但来自欧洲的证据表明，合成大麻素在无家可归者和监狱囚犯等社会边缘群体中是一个严重的问题。	However, evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.	no
有22个国家报告了监狱中使用新型精神活性物质的情况，其中大多数国家将合成大麻素确定为主要挑战。	Twenty-two States reported on the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, most of which identified synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.	no
对前体化学品的管制迫使制毒者进行创新最常作为前体用来合成苯丙胺、甲基苯丙胺和“摇头丸”等毒品的许多化学品已被置于国际管制之下。	Control of precursor chemicals has forced drug producers to innovate. Many of the chemicals most often used as precursors in the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and & quot; ecstasy & quot; have been placed under international control.	no
贩毒者和制毒者一直在寻找替代品一不仅有管制较松的物质，还有专门为规避管制而设计的化学品，即所谓的“特制前体”。	Drug traffickers and drug producers have been looking for alternatives not only to less regulated substances, but also to chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, the so-called & quot; engineered precursors & quot;.	no
旨在阻止新冠肺炎传播的限制性措施很可能使依赖前体化学品的制毒者受到进一步挤压。	Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug producers dependent on precursor chemicals.	no
来自墨西哥的证据表明，这已经成为 现实：据报告，2020年3月，从东亚进口的甲基苯丙胺前体短缺促使墨西哥和美国的甲基苯丙胺价格上涨。	Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia was reported to have contributed to an increase in the price of methamphetamine in Mexico and the United States.	no
市场瞬息万变	The market is changing fast	no
合成药物在中亚和俄罗斯联邦取代阿片剂	Replacement of opiates with synthetic drugs in Central Asia and the Russian Federation	no
中亚和俄罗斯联邦的阿片剂市场在2008年至2018年期间似乎发生了变化。	The opiate markets in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appear to have changed between 2008 and 2018.	no
俄罗斯联邦当局截获的阿片剂数量下降了约80%，同时因使用类阿片而接受治疗的人数大幅减少。	The number of opiates intercepted by the authorities of the Russian Federation decreased by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use decreased significantly.	no
但兴奋剂市场却似乎日渐兴旺。	But the stimulant market seems to be booming.	no
有证据表明，甲基苯丙胺和各种卡西酮，包括甲氧麻黄酮和 a - 吡咯烷基苯戊酮，现在俄罗斯毒品市场上随处可见。	There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including mephedrone and a-pyrrolidone, are now widely available on the Russian drug market.	no
俄罗斯当局报告称，最近查获的制造各种非法药物的秘密加工点数量急剧上升，在两年内翻了一番多，2018年增至152个加工点。	The Russian authorities reported that the number of clandestine laboratories manufacturing various illicit drugs that had recently been seized had risen sharply, more than doubling in two years, to 152 laboratories in 2018.	no
阿富汗和伊拉克甲基苯丙胺市场增长	Growth in the methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq	no
早在2012年，对医院、监狱和其他机构人员的调查就已经揭示了甲基苯丙胺在伊拉克的重要性。	As early as 2012, surveys of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.	no
结晶甲基苯丙胺已经成为“芬乃他林”和曲马多之外又一种令人担忧的主要药物。	Crystalline methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern beyond Captagon and tramadol.	no
2015年的一项研宄进一步证实了这些发现，吸毒者表示大麻比“芬乃他林”或甲基苯丙胺更难获得。	A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users stating that cannabis is more difficult to obtain than "phentermine" or methamphetamine.	no
最近，伊拉克当局发现了多个甲基苯丙胺加工点，麻管局已对伪麻黄碱制剂的大批进口表示关切一甲基苯丙胺加工点将这些制剂用作前体。	Recently, the Iraqi authorities uncovered several methamphetamine laboratories, and the Board has expressed concern about the large imports of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors by methamphetamine laboratories.	no
在阿富汗，甲基苯丙胺制造似乎始于2014年。	In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacture appears to have started in 2014.	no
自那时起，甲基苯丙胺的缉获量一直在稳步上升。	Seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing since then.	no
但2019年上半年的缉获量一^657公斤——与上一年相比大幅骤增。	Seizures in the first half of 2019, however, amounted to 1 ^ 657 kg - a sharp increase from the previous year.	no
在其他国家大量缉获了据认为源自阿富汗的甲基苯丙胺，这也表明该国的产量正在迅速上升。	Large seizures of methamphetamine believed to originate in Afghanistan in other countries also indicate that production in that country is rising rapidly.	no
政策变化和变化趋势	Policy changes and trends	yes
非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域大多有大麻使用增多的趋势	Most jurisdictions legalizing non-medical use of cannabis show a trend towards increased use of cannabis	yes
加拿大、乌拉圭和美国的11个法域允许制造大麻产品供非医疗使用。	Manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use was permitted in 11 jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States.	yes
在其中多数法域，大麻使用自合法化以来有所增多，尽管在其他未将非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域也观察到了同样的趋势。	In most of those jurisdictions, cannabis use had increased since legalization, although a similar trend had been observed in other jurisdictions where non-medical use of cannabis had not been legalized.	yes
在美国最早通过立法的两个州科罗拉多州和华盛顿州，成年人非医疗使用大麻的情况增加，特别是过去一个月以及每天或几乎每天使用的情况增多，自2012年起便已超过了全国平均水平。	In the first two states in the United States, Colorado and Washington, non-medical use of cannabis by adults has increased, particularly over the past month and on a daily or almost daily basis, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.	yes
所有指标都显示，自2011年以来，乌拉圭的大麻使用情况有所增加，上月使用情况几乎翻了一番。	All indicators show an increase in cannabis use in Uruguay since 2011, with use almost doubling in the previous month.	yes
这表明增加的主要原因是经常和频繁使用大麻。	This indicates that the main reason for the increase is the regular and frequent use of cannabis.	yes
加拿大的短期数据也表明，2018年至2019年合法市场扩大的同时，使用量也在增加。	Short-term data from Canada also indicate that use is increasing as the legal market expands between 2018 and 2019.	yes
然而，2019年仍有40%的大麻使用者靠非法来源获得某些产品。	However, in 2019, 40 per cent of cannabis users still had access to certain products from illicit sources.	yes
全球大麻药草缉获量暴跌的背后原因是大麻合法化？	Is the legalization of cannabis the reason behind the plunge in global cannabis herb seizures?	yes
2018年，全球大麻药草缉获量降至20年来的最低水平，这是因为北美的缉获量下降，在过去10年中下降了 84%。	In 2018, global seizures of cannabis herb fell to their lowest level in 20 years, owing to a decline in seizures in North America, which fell by 84 per cent over the past 10 years.	no
相比之下，同期世界其他地区的缉获量几乎翻了一番。缉获的模式表明，旨在放开大麻市场的政策在下降中发挥了关键作用。	In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled over the same period, and seizure patterns suggest that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.	no
对新型精神活性物质的监管似乎有遏制作用在国内对新型精神活性物质的监管效果仍然很难评估。	Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect. The effectiveness of domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances remains difficult to assess.	no
一些对新型精神活性物质采用不同监管制度的国家显示出不同的新型精神活性物质使用流行率。	Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances have shown different prevalence rates for the use of new psychoactive substances.	no
在另一些国家，通过国内立法后，新型精神活性物质使用情况有所减少。	In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances had decreased as a result of the adoption of domestic legislation.	no
弱势群体面临合法和非法毒品市场的伤害用于疼痛管理和姑息治疗的药用类阿片主要在高收入国家提供止痛药在各区域分布不均。	Vulnerable groups face harm from licit and illicit drug markets Pharmaceutical opioids for pain management and palliative care are unevenly distributed across regions, mainly in high-income countries.	no
2018年，所有可供医疗消费的药用类阿片中，90%以上在高收入国家。	In 2018, more than 90 per cent of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.	no
大约50%在北美，40%在欧洲，还有2%在大洋洲。	About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.	no
这些国家的人口约占全球人口的12%。	These countries account for about 12 per cent of the global population.	no
据估计，低收入和中等收入国家的人口占全球人口的88%,但消费的药用类阿片却不到10%。	It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries account for 88 per cent of the global population, but consume less than 10 per cent of pharmaceutical opioids.	no
获取药用类阿片的障碍与许多因素有关，包括立法、文化、卫生系统和处方做法。	Obstacles to access to pharmaceutical opioids are linked to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescription practices.	no
较贫穷的人患吸毒病症的风险更大2018年约有3,560万人患有吸毒病症。	Poor people are at greater risk of drug use disorders In 2018, about 35.6 million people had drug use disorders.	no
贫困、有限的教育和社会边缘化可能会增加吸毒病症风险，并加剧其后果。高收入国家的研宄证实了这一点，在这些研究中，个人不利的社会经济轨迹一不仅仅是他们在某一时间点的状况一也与吸毒病症风险有关。	Poverty, limited education and social marginalization can increase the risk and exacerbate the consequences of drug use disorders, as evidenced by studies in high-income countries in which individuals & apos; adverse socio-economic trajectories are associated with the risk of drug use disorders not only with their condition at a given point in time.	no
吸毒病症还会加深社会经济劣势，进一步增加失业、贫困和无家可归的风险，从而助长劣势的恶性循环。这些结果也可能与刑事司法系统内的侮辱性态度和后果有关。	Drug use disorders also contribute to the vicious cycle of disadvantage by deepening socioeconomic disadvantage and further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, which may also be associated with stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.	no
妇女、少数民族和移民、性取向多样化群体、因武装冲突或灾难而流离失所的人以及农村环境中的人也可能受到吸毒病症的过重影响，或者在获得治疗服务方面遇到问题。	Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexual diversity groups, persons displaced by armed conflict or disaster and persons in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug use disorders or experience problems in accessing treatment services.	no
根据估计因残疾和过早死亡而损失的健康寿命年数的残疾调整寿命年（DALY)指标，在过去10年中，有害的吸毒对范围更广的社会影响加重。	According to the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost as a result of disability and premature death, the impact of harmful drug use on wider society has increased over the past 10 years.	no
2007年至2018年间，归因于吸毒的全球残疾调整寿命年数增加了 17%。	Between 2007 and 2018, the global number of disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17 per cent.	no
注射吸毒者中常见的未经治疗的丙型肝炎导致的肝癌的相关残疾调整寿命年数增幅特别高——达到40%。	The increase in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with liver cancer due to untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, is particularly high - up to 40 per cent.	no
毒品和暴力之间的关系错综复杂很难确定精神活性物质的使用和暴力之间的所有因果关系。	The complex relationship between drugs and violence makes it difficult to establish all causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.	no
全球范围的有限数据表明，迷醉可能是杀人的一个重要因素。	The limited data available globally suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.	no
但在暴力事件中，酒精的作用似乎比毒品更大。	But in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a greater role than drugs.	no
虽然吸毒可能会导致犯罪，但在某些情况下，这种联系可以部分归因于多种中介因素，如社会经济劣势以及由个人风险、家庭环境和同龄人影响造成的其他类型的逆境。	While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases the link can be partly attributed to multiple mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment and peer influence.	no
贩毒和暴力之间的联系是多方面的。	The links between drug trafficking and violence are multifaceted.	no
如果已有稳定的犯罪结构，包括国际贩毒在内的大规模有组织犯罪活动有可能在无暴力的情况下实施。	Large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out without violence if stable criminal structures are in place.	no
短期内，暴力的存在和程度与其说取决于贩运的数量，不如说取决于造成有组织犯罪集团之间力量平衡不稳定的某些变化，例如非法市场规模的变化，知名罪犯的死亡或监禁，以及使一个集团弱于另一个集团的执法措施。	In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depend less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.	no
最新趋势	Recent trends	yes
吸毒大麻是最常用的物质，类阿片危害最大	Cannabis use is the most commonly used substance, with opioids the most harmful	yes
据估计，2018年使用大麻的有 1.92 亿人，使之成为全球使用最多的毒品。	An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug globally.	yes
相比之下，2018年使用类阿片的有5,800万人。	In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.	yes
但阿片类药物的相关危害却因使用者较少而受到忽视。	However, the harm associated with opioids has been neglected due to the small number of users.	yes
在2017年与吸毒病症有关的估计167,000例死亡中，有66%是这类物质造成的，在据信为吸毒导致的残疾或过早死亡而损失的2,100万年寿命中，有50%是这类物质造成的。	Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66 per cent were caused by such substances and 50 per cent of the 21 million years of life believed to have been lost as a result of disability or premature death from drug use were caused by such substances.	yes
合成类阿片的非医疗使用加剧了公共卫生危机	Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates the public health crisis	yes
在西非、中部非洲和北非，加剧类阿片危机的是曲马多；在北美则是芬太尼。这两个区域在经济、人口统计数据或一般吸毒模式方面几乎没有共同点，但都在奋力抗击由容易获得且生产成本低的物质助长的类阿片危机。	In West, Central and North Africa, the opioid crisis was exacerbated by tramadol and in North America by fentanyl, two regions that had little in common in terms of economy, demographics or general patterns of drug use but were struggling to combat the opioid crisis fuelled by easily available and low-cost substances.	yes
在北美，芬太尼等合成类阿片的使用导致了20年来类阿片过量致死人数增加。	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.	yes
2018年，在美国登记的67,367例过量死亡中，有三分之二涉及芬太尼。	In 2018, two thirds of the 67,367 excess deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.	yes
加拿大也报告了类似的结果，只是数字较低。	Similar results were reported by Canada, although the figures were lower.	no
芬太尼导致过量死亡的部分原因是非法药物市场上的芬太尼药效不可预测。	Fentanyl causes overdose deaths in part because of the unpredictable effects of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.	no
在西非、中部非洲和北非，非医疗用途曲马多的市场已有大幅增长。	In West, Central and North Africa, the non-medical market for tramadol has grown significantly.	no
在该区域，接受治疗的曲马多使用病症患者越来越多。	In the region, a growing number of patients with tramadol use disorders are receiving treatment.	no
2017年，全球截获的曲马多数量显著增加，达到125吨以上的峰值。	In 2017, the amount of tramadol intercepted globally increased significantly, peaking at over 125 tons.	no
但2018年，在印度通过一项监管曲马多的新法律之后，全球缉获量降至32吨。	In 2018, however, global seizures fell to 32 tons following the adoption of a new law regulating tramadol in India.	no
促成这两地危机的是制造简单和生产成本低，此外还有对曲马多和许多芬太尼类似物或其前体缺乏国际监管。	The crisis in both places is due to the simplicity and low cost of manufacture, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.	no
使这两地危机恶化的是这些物质在药品市场和非法市场上都有供应，因而更加难以发现和防止其滥用。	The crisis in both places is exacerbated by the fact that these substances are available on both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making their abuse more difficult to detect and prevent.	no
兴奋剂使用不断增多	Growing use of stimulants	no
兴奋剂领域以可卡因和甲基苯丙胺为主，这两种物质在其主要市场的使用量都在上升。	The field of stimulants is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasing in use in their main markets.	no
2018年使用可卡因的约有1,900万人，因为可卡因在北美和西欧颇为流行。	In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine because of its popularity in North America and Western Europe.	no
同年使用苯丙胺的约有2,700万人，其中甲基苯丙胺是东南亚和北美使用最多的苯丙胺类兴奋剂。	In the same year, about 27 million people used amphetamines, of which methamphetamine was the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.	no
根据所掌握的多数指标，20年来这两个区域甲基苯丙胺的使用一直在扩大。	According to most available indicators, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for the past 20 years.	no
在一些市场上，可卡因和甲基苯丙胺可以共存，有时是相互替代，这样一种药物的使用量上升时另一种药物的使用量就下降，有时是同时增加和减少以满足同一市场的需求。	In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that when the use of one drug increases, the use of the other decreases, sometimes simultaneously increasing and decreasing to meet the demand of the same market.	no
新冠肺炎使注射吸毒者的风险增高	Neocoronitis increases the risk for people who inject drugs	no
据估计，2018年注射吸毒的约有1,130万人，全球艾滋病毒感染约有10%是注射吸毒造成的。	It is estimated that about 11.3 million people injected drug use in 2018 and that about 10 per cent of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drug use.	no
注射吸毒者感染艾滋病毒的超过100万人，患丙型肝炎的有550万人。	More than 1 million people who inject drugs are living with HIV and 5.5 million people are living with hepatitis C.	no
2017年，因吸毒死亡的约有 58.5万人，其中一半死于丙型肝炎引起的肝病，而注射吸毒者的丙型肝炎大多仍未得到治疗。	In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of them from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, which remains largely untreated among injecting drug users.	no
5 新冠肺炎限制措施造成的类阿片短缺可能导致使用者代之以酒精或苯二氮类药物等更容易获得的物质，或者将类阿片与合成药物混合。	The shortage of opioids as a result of restrictive measures against COVID-19 may lead users to substitute more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.	no
随着一些使用者改用注射或更频繁地注射，可能会出现更多有害的使用方式。	As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful patterns of use may emerge.	no

欧盟峰会为难民政策争吵不休，欧盟官员：接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈	EU officials: Every step of the reception process is a bottleneck	yes
【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	At the latest EU summit, European Commission President Von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration as a way to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants, according to AFP on February 10.	yes
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	The EU's move is reportedly a response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, where the core problem today is that the number of illegal immigrants who end up being repatriated is small.	yes
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funds" to strengthen external borders, including through infrastructure and surveillance.	yes
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	However, the EU has been arguing with member States over issues such as the payment of fence fees.	yes
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	Von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not cover the costs.	yes
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	But diplomats from some member states say that if the EU could share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external border, it would free up national budgets and thus speed up the construction process.	yes
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	According to Euractiv, EU officials acknowledged that there were bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, that limited reception capacity and overburdened immigration authorities in member states were unable to prevent refugees from submitting "numerous" asylum applications in EU countries, and that the EU's refugee reception system was in a near-" permanent crisis. "	yes
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half that of the previous year.	yes
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	Meanwhile, the European Union recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.	no
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	Against this background, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries can return illegal migrants to their home countries on the basis of a court decision in another member state.	no
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	In addition, EU leaders have reportedly agreed to "increase the use of the safe state concept," which will open the way for the EU to develop a common list.	no

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	US upgrade "chip war" hit the global semiconductor industry - ChinaNews.com	yes
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	Recently, the US "chip war" with China has escalated - first the Netherlands and Japan agreed, under pressure from the US, to impose controls on the export of Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment; then foreign media reported that the US government is considering cutting all ties between US suppliers and Huawei and prohibiting US suppliers from supplying any products to Huawei; and the Biden administration is preparing to issue an executive order restricting US investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries.	yes
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	In recent years, the US has never stopped attacking the development of China's "core," while precisely cracking down on the semiconductor supply chain to China and building a "de-Sinicization" semiconductor industry chain alliance in an attempt to "get rid of" China completely in the advanced semiconductor industry.	yes
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it is by coalescing South Korea into a "technology alliance," establishing a "quadrilateral alliance" of chips with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, or creating a "small circle" of semiconductor chains through mechanisms such as the "quadrilateral mechanism" between the United States, Japan, India, and Australia, or the "Indo-Pacific economic framework," the US is introducing the semiconductor industry through politicization, commercialization, and weaponization in an attempt to build a closed supply chain cycle led by the US.	yes
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	However, the United States' highly publicized "core tactic" against China was to "damage the enemy by one thousand and eight hundred."	yes
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	Recently, Pan Lin Group, a well-known US chip-manufacturing equipment supplier, announced that it will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plan to lay off 1,400 temporary employees over the next two quarters, in response to the latest round of export bans on chip-manufacturing equipment to China.	yes
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	The global photolithography giant Dutch Asmaa Holdings recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to an increase in the price of semiconductors.	yes
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	According to US media analysis, many US companies, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves, have been harmed by the US government's brutal crackdown on China's chip and semiconductor industries.	yes
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	The United States claims that it is cracking down on China's advanced semiconductor industry, but it is dragging down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.	yes
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a high-technology and knowledge-intensive industry that has long formed a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain.	yes
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	According to professional estimates, the entire production process of semiconductor products takes more than 70 times across national borders, over 100 days, based on specialization.	no
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong base, it has a weak manufacturing capacity, especially in advanced process technology, and is heavily dependent on the East Asian region.	no
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	Even as the US tries to steer the supply chain of advanced chips toward the US-led regionalization of "small circles," the regional distribution and interdependence of the world's semiconductor-related industries will be hard to change.	no
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The United States has aggressively "reshaped" and "de-Chinaized" the semiconductor industry, devastating the global semiconductor industry.	no
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry requires the participation of all countries around the world.	no
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, such as the Innovation and Competition Act, the US Competition Act of 2022, and the Chips and Science Act, which use technological hegemony to strengthen the country's technological leadership, and "envy" to allies, forcing Intel, TSMC, Samsung, and other chip manufacturers to set up factories in the United States, striving to secure the United States' global leadership in the chip field.	no
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	In the short term, the US did create problems and reap real benefits for China's chip and related industries.	no
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	But, in the long run, the hysteria of the US cracking down on China's chip industry, forcing it to break through and lose its huge Chinese market, will ultimately undermine the willingness and ability of US technology companies to innovate, and undermine the global chip industry.	no

近日，知名健身机构中健健身会员维权问题引起社会关注。	Recently, the issue of protecting the rights of healthy members in well-known fitness facilities has attracted social attention.	yes
春节后不少会员发现自己所在门店没有正常营业，随后，关于该机构倒闭跑路的传闻引起会员恐慌，导致公安、人社部门介入。	Many of the members found that their stores did not operate normally after the Spring Festival, and rumors about the closure of the agency caused panic among the members, which led to the intervention of the public security and human society departments.	yes
最后，该机构相关负责人出面回应，承诺会努力保障好员工和会员的合法权益，风波才得以平息。	In the end, the organization's leaders responded by promising to work to protect the legitimate rights and interests of its employees and members.	yes
个别健身机构的部分门店出现经营问题，暂时关闭，消费者本可心平气和等待问题解决，为何不少会员的第一反应是“大事不妙”？	When some of the stores of individual fitness facilities have run into operational problems and are temporarily closed, and consumers can sit back and wait for the problem to be solved, why do so many members "first reaction is" something bad.

健身房跑路等行业负面信息频频传出，对消费者信心造成强烈冲击。	Negative messages from the industry, such as running gyms, have a strong impact on consumer confidence.	yes

形势越是趋好，行业越需重视发展质量。	The better the situation, the more the industry needs to focus on the quality of development.	no

没有私教推销，没有巨额年卡，用户对健身机构“跑路”的担忧降低了，信任感也就提升了。	Without private marketing, and without huge annual cards, users "concerns about the" run-of-the-mill "of fitness facilities are reduced, and trust is increased.	no
另外，还要积极探索多元业态。	There is also a need to actively explore a variety of business models.	no

南京楼市再现“差价赔付”-中新网	Reproduction of the property market in Nanjing "difference payment" - 中新网	yes
扬子晚报讯(记者 马祚波)扬子晚报/紫牛新闻记者10日在采访中发现，十余年未见的“保价协议”又重回了南京楼市，位于江北新区的一家楼盘宣称“差价赔付”，在交房前其他房源的优惠大于之前的折扣，开发商愿意为买房人换房并退还差价。	According to the New York Times, the New York Times reported that the New York Times reported that the "New York Times" and the New York Times reported that the "New York Times" and the New York Times reported that the "New York Times" and the New York Times reported that the "New York Times" and the New York Times reported that the "New York Times" and the New York Times reported that the "New York Times" and the "New York Times" were "not the same."	yes
“保价协议”条件可不少	There can be a number of conditions for a "premium agreement."	yes
这家位于江北新区的楼盘名为保利扬子萃云台，看房人孙先生告诉记者，他在上周末逛楼盘时发现了一则“声明”。	The property in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Suyuntai, and the house watchman, Mr. Sun, told reporters that he found a "statement" while walking around the property last weekend.	yes
他发给记者的图片上显示，该楼盘的开发商承诺，凡是在2月1日-2月28日期间购买房源的，自双方签订买卖合同之日起至对应房源交付，若该项目其他房源的优惠折扣大于之前购房所享折扣的(限与该商品房属于同一户型、同一楼栋、同一单元、同一物业类型的其他未售商品房)，开发商可以为购房者换房并退还差价。	For example, in the case of a property purchased between 1 February and 28 February, the purchaser of the property is entitled to a refund of the difference in the price of the property if the price of the property is less than the price of the property purchased in the previous period (limited to other unsold properties of the same type, in the same building, in the same unit and in the same property).	yes
孙先生表示，置业顾问表示这其实就是一份“保价协议”，目的是让买家放心出手，不用担心开发企业降价促销，“现在就怕买完了它就降价了，去售楼处闹吧没时间，不闹的话也确实窝心”。	According to Mr. Sun, the real estate consultant said that it was a "price insurance agreement" in fact, the purpose is to make the buyer feel safe, do not worry about the development of the company's price reduction promotion, "I am afraid that it will be reduced when I buy it, I will not go to the sales office and I will not be able to do it."	yes
还有不少买房人则认为，“保价协议”虽然是在给购房者吃“定心丸”，不过条件却不低。	Many homebuyers believe that the "premium agreement" is a "pill" for homebuyers, but the terms are not too low.	yes
打算在江北买一套刚需房的郑女士说，保价的房源首先是要同一户型，还得在同一楼栋、同一个单元，买家可以比价的房源寥寥，因此“门槛”还是蛮高的。	According to the New York City Department of Housing and Urban Development, the price of a home is the same as the price of a home, and the price of a home is the same as the price of a home.	yes
也有购房者认为，由于信息不对称，销售时不排除给出额外的让利，买家“维权”的难度不小。	Some buyers also argue that because of the asymmetry of information, the sale does not exclude the granting of additional concessions, making it difficult for buyers to "defend their rights."	yes
能否留住买房人有待观察	It remains to be seen if buyers will be retained	no
记者在南京网上房地产上查询得知，该楼盘于去年11月首领两幢楼共计252套房源的销许，户型面积有105平方米、114平方米、129平方米等，全装修销许均价为39843元/㎡。	Reporters in Nanjing online real estate inquiries learned that the property was sold in November last year for a total of 252 apartments in the two buildings of the chief, housing area of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., all renovated and sold at an average price of 39,843 yuan / m2.	no
不过两个多月过去，网上房地产显示目前该楼盘的未售总套数为157套，占比为62.3%，其中8号楼共计128套，未售套数达113套，7号楼的124套中也有44套未售，项目的总成交套数只有33套，占比仅为13%。	However, more than two months later, online real estate showed that the total number of unsold units in the current property was 157, or 62.3%, of which the total number of unsold units in Building 8 was 128, or 113, and the total number of unsold units in Building 7 was 44, or 33, or 13%.	no
市场人士介绍，“保价协议”在2008年也曾在南京出现过。	It was also announced that a "free" version of the game would be released in Japan in 2008.	no
当年8月份，河西黄山路上的楼盘横塘西苑为了吸引买房人眼球，推出了《保价计划》，具体内容为“公司郑重承诺，若一年内项目优惠幅度扩大，由此产生的差额，公司将按差额退还给老业主”。	In August of that year, in order to attract the attention of buyers, Hengtang West Park on the Hexi Huangshan Road, introduced the "Insurance Plan," the specific content of which is "the company solemnly promises that if the preferential margin of the project is expanded within a year, the resulting difference will be refunded to the old owner."	no
此后2011年4月，南京也有9家楼盘拿出部分房源承诺“差价赔付”。	In April 2011, nine properties in Nanjing pledged to pay the "difference payment."	no
“楼市在回暖，此时更需要一针‘强心剂’。	"The market is warming up," he said, "and now we need a strong shot."	no
”南京地产行业一位资深操盘手沈先生表示，“保价协议”也是房企的营销方式之一。	According to Mr. Shen, a senior trader in the Nanjing real estate industry, the "premium agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of housing companies.	no
他认为如今开发企业比买房人更需要信心，推出“保价协议”其实也是在给其打气。	He argues that today's developers need more confidence than homebuyers, and that the introduction of "price premiums" is actually giving them a boost.	no
至于能否留住买房人，他表示这取决于调控政策、贷款门槛等多重因素的影响，就目前来看仍有待观察。	As for the ability to retain buyers, he said that it depended on a combination of factors, such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, which remained to be seen for the time being.	no

新华社台北2月11日电(记者赵博、黄扬)出口贸易额“连五黑”，制造业采购经理人指数(PMI)连续7个月紧缩，消费者物价指数(CPI)又见“3字头”……近期，台湾当局陆续发布2023年1月经济数据。	Xinhua News Agency Taipei, February 11 (Reporters Zhao Bo, Huang Yang) Export trade volume "five consecutive black," manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) contracted for seven consecutive months, consumer price index (CPI) also see "three digits"...	yes

统计显示，1月台湾地区进出口双降，出超金额仅23.4亿美元，创近3年来最低水平。	Statistics show that imports and exports from Taiwan fell in January, with an excess of US $2.34 billion, the lowest level in the past three years.	yes
台当局财政事务主管部门认为，全球终端需求减少，产业调整库存抑制厂商购料意愿，出口颓势短期难见改善，台湾今年首季出口衰退恐高于预期。	According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the decline in exports in the first quarter of this year is likely to be higher than expected, as a result of the decline in global terminal demand, industrial adjustment of inventories, and the decline in exports.	no
据台湾中华经济研究院发布，今年1月台湾制造业采购经理人指数(PMI)经季节调整后为40.4%，较去年12月续跌3.3个百分点，连续7个月紧缩。	According to the Taiwan Institute of Chinese Economic Research, the Taiwan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) contracted for seven consecutive months, with a seasonally adjusted fall of 3.3 percentage points from last December to 40.4% in January.	no

1月台湾PMI五项组成指标中，新增订单、生产与人力雇佣紧缩，供应商交货时间下降，存货紧缩。	In January, the five components of the PMI in Taiwan saw a contraction in new orders, production and employment, a decline in delivery times for suppliers, and a contraction in inventories.	no

其中，蔬菜价格飞涨28.25%，创17个月新高。	Of these, vegetable prices soared by 28.25 per cent, a 17-month high.	no
台“主计总处”专门委员曹志弘坦言，菜价涨幅确实超乎预期，排除春节因素，今年1月和2月平均CPI应接近去年12月的2.71%，通胀压力还是存在，且仍在高点。	Cao Zhihong, a special committee member of Taiwan's "master planner's office," admitted that the price increase was indeed more than expected, and that the average CPI in January and February of this year should be close to 2.71% of last December, excluding the Chinese New Year factor, and inflation pressure still exists and is still high.	no
展望今年台湾经济，综合《联合报》、“Yahoo财经”等岛内媒体报道，专家表示悲观。	This year, the Taiwanese economy is expected to see a combination of reports from the United Daily News, Yahoo Finance, and other local media outlets.	no
台“中央大学”经济系教授吴大任分析，出口衰退可能造成出口制造业厂商现金流出现问题，债务违约风险上升。	According to Wu Daoren, a professor of economics at Taiwan's Chung-Ang University, a decline in exports could cause cash flow problems for export manufacturers and increase the risk of default.	no
同时，订单减少导致厂商削减人力成本，影响劳动市场和家庭经济，反过来冲击消费能力。	At the same time, reduced orders cause manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn impinges on consumption capacity.	no
台湾经济研究院研究员邱达生认为，今年欧美通胀状况未解，需求持续萎缩，预估台湾出口衰退会延续到上半年。	According to a report by the Institute of Economic Research in Taiwan, Qiu Da-sheng believes that the inflation situation in the United States and Europe is not clear this year, and demand continues to shrink, and it is expected that the decline in exports in Taiwan will continue until the first half of the year.	no

“无内容，不电商”，随着短视频和直播电商不断发展，人们对电商内容的要求和标准正步入新阶段。	"No content, no e-commerce," as short video and live commerce continue to develop, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new phase.	no

报告认为，电商行业内容生态是一个综合性概念，是将电商与内容进行整合，但并非所有内容都可与电商整合，好的PGC(专业生产内容)与UGC(用户原创内容)才是与电商进行整合的优质载体，内容平台价值越高，消费与推广的场景也就越来越丰富，电商植入的可能性也就越高，商业价值也就越强，这种公共领域和私人领域逐步集成分布的电商内容生产和内容消费的比例也就会越高。	According to the report, the e-commerce content ecosystem is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce, and good PGC (professional production content) and UGC (user original content) are the best carriers for integration with e-commerce, the higher the value of the content platform, the richer the consumption and promotion scenario, the higher the possibility of e-commerce insertion, the greater the commercial value.	no

同时，内容成为电商发展新阶段的根本和抓手，知识付费、专业性知识、KOL(关键意见领袖)等PGC内容开始在电商直播中成为标配。	At the same time, content became the basis and starting point of the new stage of e-commerce development, knowledge payment, professional knowledge, KOL (Key Opinion Leader), etc. PGC content began to become standard in e-commerce live streaming.	no
展望电商行业的未来发展，喻国明提出两方面的建议。	Looking ahead to the future of the electricity industry, Metsä made two recommendations.	no
一个是从内容结构提升的角度看，推动电商内容生态健康程度和质量整体提升，打造正向内容创作和管理标准，实现电商行业内容生态健康系统指数与动态均衡。	One is from the perspective of improving the content structure, to promote the overall improvement of the ecological health and quality of e-commerce content, to create positive content creation and management standards, and to achieve a balance between the index and the dynamics of the e-commerce industry & apos; s content ecosystem.	no
另一个是从外部生态看，要实现内容电商行业的健康发展和外部环境的价值协同与共创。	The other is to realize the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value of the external environment from the perspective of the external environment.	no

然而，第一夫人李雪主只能退到一旁。	First Lady Lee Xuezhong, however, was forced to step aside.	yes
综合韩国“朝鲜新闻”等报导，金正恩、李雪主夫妇7日带著女儿金主爱出席晚宴的官方合照中，金主爱不仅罕见坐在父母正中间C位，在隔日晚间建军节第75周年阅兵仪式上，她还与金正恩一起登上主席台。	In the official photo of Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol Ju at a dinner party with their daughter Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-un not only rarely sits in the middle C of their parents, but also sits on the podium with Kim Jong-un at the 75th anniversary military parade the next evening.	yes
朝鲜官媒“朝鲜中央电视台”事后释出阅兵式影片，曝光了更多父女情深的画面。	The Korean Central Television (KCNA), the official media of North Korea, later released a military parade video, revealing more of the affection between father and daughter.	yes
金正恩在主席台上数次与女儿对望，两人脸上的笑容从未退去，还互相在耳边讲悄悄话，金主爱一度以双手捧起老爸的两颊，金正恩也以灿笑回应。	Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter on the podium several times, and the smile on their faces never faded, and they whispered in each other's ears, and Kim once loved his father's cheeks with his hands, and Kim responded with a smile.	yes
其他官媒画面也显示，金主爱与金正恩坐在室内沙发椅上时，用手不断摸著父亲的脸；她与父亲挽著手走路时，一边用手摸在金正恩的胸口。	Other state media accounts also show Kim Jong-un sitting on an indoor sofa with Kim Jong-un, touching her father's face with her hands; and Kim Jong-un's chest with her hands as she walked with her father.	yes
而第一夫人李雪主全程只能走在后头或是坐在一旁，总是距离丈夫和女儿有几步之差。	First Lady Li Xuezhong could only walk or sit in the back, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.	yes
韩国媒体指出，金主爱自去年11月18日试射火星17飞弹首次在公开露脸以来，3个月以来曝光机率越来越高，至今已是第5度出现于正式场合。	According to the South Korean media, Kim's exposure has increased in the past three months since the first public appearance of the Mars 17 missile on 18 November last year, and it is now the fifth official appearance.	yes
朝鲜官媒提及金主爱时使用了最亲爱的子弟、尊贵的子弟等极高尊称，也播出金主爱在看台上俯瞰阅兵行进时反覆高喊誓死拥护白头血统的片段。	It was also the first time in the history of the United States that the use of the word "child" was used in reference to a child, and the use of the word "child" in reference to a child was used in reference to a child's love for a child, and the use of the word "child" in reference to a child's love for a child.	no
这些迹象让外界怀疑金主爱是否已经被内定为金氏政权的继承人，《华盛顿邮报》分析认为“这是金正恩把中学年纪的女儿推上接班人地位的讯号”，不过也有观点认为，这样的判断仍为时过早，在金正恩膝下有儿子的情况中，仍保有各种可能性。	According to the Washington Post, "this is a sign that Kim Jong-un is pushing his daughter of secondary school age to the position of successor," although some have argued that this is too early and that various possibilities remain in the case of Kim Jong-un having a son under his knee.	no
重阳问答︱如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	New York Times New York Times New York Times New York Times New York Times New York Times New York Times New York Times New York Times.	yes
Q：请问重阳投资，如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势？	Q: How do you view the US non-farm payroll data for January and the outlook for investment?	yes
A：2月3日美国劳工部公布2023年1月非农就业数据，新增非农就业51.7万人，大幅高于市场预期的18.9万人；失业率降至3.4%，为近50年以来的最低位；时薪同比增速4.4%，环比增速0.3%，略有放缓。	A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor released data on non-farm employment for January 2023, adding 517,000 new non-farm jobs, significantly exceeding market expectations by 189,000. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years.	yes
从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	In aggregate terms, the data are subject to a number of one-off and technical disturbances, such as staff returning from strikes, a revision of the survey's statistical calibre, and an update of the seasonality factor, which may be revised (referring to the January 2022 addition of non-farm workers, from 504,000 to 364,000), non-farm employment, or not as strong as the data suggest.	yes
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	Structurally, the impact of job cuts in high-tech firms is still present, but relatively low; new jobs in high-touch services, such as leisure hotels and education and health care, have rebounded sharply, and data suggest that the service labor gap remains.	yes
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Combined with the similarly better-than-expected service PMI, the rebound in job openings and labor gap data, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service sector has experienced a quick fix after extreme weather and holidays.	yes
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	We believe that the tight supply and demand in the United States job market will not improve without a recession.	yes
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	With more than five million supply gaps in the US labor market, the labor-force participation rate has been slow to rise, especially among 25-54-year-olds, who are nearing pre-pandemic highs.	yes
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	Moreover, strong consumer demand will cause the impact of austerity on the job market to lag further, owing to excess savings and strong consumer credit in the United States.	yes
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	Continued tight supply and demand in the US job market will underpin the US economy in 2023.	yes
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	With the superposition now nearing the end of interest-rate hikes and repeated inflation expectations, we are not optimistic that wage growth will continue to decline.	no
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Prior to the release of the data, US stock bond markets had been overly optimistic about the Fed's interest-rate hike path.	no
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	As inflation data continue to improve, the Fed is shortening the pace of interest-rate hikes while maintaining a fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but markets have turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish rhetoric, anticipating not only an early halt to interest-rate hikes, but also two rate cuts by the end of the year.	no
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	With labor market supply and demand tight and the impact of austerity uncertain, we believe that the Fed's year-end guidance for interest-rate hikes is relatively reasonable, and that the market's extreme expected adjustments and trading congestion may hurt the market somewhat.	no
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	Nonetheless, the persistence of wage growth is unlikely to reverse the current rapid decline in inflation, with the M2 data turning negative year on year and leading CPI indicators gradually improving, and the US CPI data having shifted to a rapid decline since October. The persistence of wage growth will only underpin future inflation data, and current market expectations will be hard to disprove, and the market will enter a new round of games once inflation data are released.	no

就在服装业务如日中天时，杉杉集团却开始转型，因为郑永刚意识到 ， “ 一旦市场放开，中国品牌自然会形成一个梯队式品牌市场，杉杉西服想一直独领风骚，长期成为国人的国服的可能性不大 ” 。	In the middle of the day in the clothing business, Shanshui Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened, the Chinese brand will naturally form a caucus-style brand market, Shanshui suits want to have been unique, long-term national clothing is unlikely."	yes
1999年，杉杉开始研究企业转型，郑永刚回忆当年 ， “ 我们来到上海，寻求到底转型做什么，专门找了很多专家学者，连续不断地开一些诸葛亮会、务虚研讨会。	In 1999, Shisui began to study corporate transformation, Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai, looking for what to do in the end of the transformation, specially recruited a lot of experts and scholars, continued to hold a number of Zhuge Liang meetings, retreat seminars.	yes
最后，我们设定了两个大的战略方向。	Finally, we have set two broad strategic directions.	yes
第一个方向是新能源新材料，另外一个是大健康有未来 ” 。	The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the second is great health and the future. "	yes
战略方向确定后，杉杉开始寻找合作，那时候鞍山热能院为鞍钢配套的炭素研究所在做国家863课题，科研经费不够，于是杉杉和鞍山热能院碳素研究所签署合作协议，共同推动国家863课题“中间相炭微球”项目产业化，从事负极材料的研发、生产和销售，在国内实现负极材料的商用推广。	After the strategic direction was determined, Sugi began to look for cooperation, at that time Anshan Institute of Thermal Energy for Angang Institute of Carbon Research was doing national 863 project, research funding was insufficient, so Sugi and the Institute of Carbon Research of Anshan Institute of Thermal Energy signed a cooperation agreement to promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Intermediate Phase Carbon Microsphere" project, engaged in the development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, to achieve commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.	yes
2001年，杉杉股份实现中间相炭微球的规模化生产，开始国产化替代，取代日本成为国内中间相炭微球主要供应商。	In 2001, the company began to produce intermediate carbon microspheres on a large scale, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate carbon microspheres.	no
这是中国第一家锂离子电池负极材料生产企业，实现了锂离子电池负极材料国产化。	It is China's first manufacturer of lithium ion battery anode materials, and has achieved the localization of lithium ion battery anode materials.	no
随着锂电池的应用迅速普及，杉杉股份的锂电池业务开始逐步发展，2007年锂电材料业务被写入了杉杉股份的主营业务，服装业务营收占比逐年减少，直至2013年，杉杉股份的锂电材料业务收入全面超过服装业务。	With the rapid spread of the use of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Sugiyama Corporation began to gradually develop, and in 2007 the lithium material business was written into the main business of Sugiyama Corporation, and the revenue share of the clothing business decreased year by year, until 2013, the lithium material business of Sugiyama Corporation exceeded the revenue of the clothing business.	no
2021年2月，杉杉股份成功并购LG化学偏光片业务，进军LCD偏光片市场，并成立偏光片企业杉金光电，该领域技术含量比较高，杉杉的主要的竞争对手都是世界500强，如韩国三星、日本的住友化学、日东电工。	In February 2021, the company successfully acquired LG Chemical's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer company Sugikin Optoelectronics, which has a high technological content in the field, and the main competitors of Sugiki are the world's top 500 companies, such as Samsung Korea, Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko.	no
郑永刚曾分享过投后管理的心得 ， “ 中国的民营企业收购国际上的一些高科技企业，成功概率比较低，为什么那些收购会失败？	Zheng Yonggang once shared the experience of post-investment management, "Chinese private companies acquire some high-tech companies internationally, the probability of success is relatively low, why do those acquisitions fail?"	no
因为大家都会去考虑，我花了那么多钱，我得去派人管对吧，这是通常会做的一个行为 ” ， 然而郑永刚则不同，杉杉收购成功的那一天，郑永刚就到杉金光电当众宣布，杉杉作为杉金的大股东，决定实施一企两制，除了郑永刚担任董事长，杉杉企业的人不派到杉金，采取授权经营的方式，原有的分配制度、企业文化、各项管理等模式不变。	It is a common practice to send people to do the right thing, because everyone will think about it, I spent so much money, I have to send people to do it right, this is a behavior that is usually done, "but unlike Zheng Yonggang, on the day of the successful acquisition of Sugijin, Zheng Yonggang went to Sugijin photoelectric publicly announced that Sugijin as a major shareholder of Sugijin, decided to implement a two-company system, except for Zheng Yonggang as chairman, Sugijin business people are not sent to Sugijin, take the original distribution system, corporate culture, management and so on.	no
ICC鑫椤资讯发布2022年负极数据显示，杉杉负极2022年出货量突破20万吨，同比增幅100 % ， 市场份额达16 % ， 人造石墨负极材料出货量蝉联榜首。	According to the data released by the ICC, the shipment volume of negative electrode materials in 2022 exceeded 200,000 tons, an increase of 100% over the same period of the previous year, and the market share reached 16%.	no
在偏光片业务方面，Yano Research统计显示，公司旗下杉金光电2022年全球市场份额达到29 % ， 预计2023年市场份额将达到32 % ， 持续位列全球第一。	In the polarizer business, according to Yano Research, the company's global market share reached 29% in 2022 and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to lead the world.	no

阿拉斯加上空被击落的 “物体”究竟是什么？	What was the "object" that was shot down over Alaska?	yes
扑朔迷离，猜测纷纷	Mysterious, speculative	yes
美国军方周五（2月10日）下午再次动用美国最先进的隐身喷气战机F-22击落了一个在美国阿拉斯加上空飞行的尚未确定身份的物体。	On the afternoon of Friday (10 February), the United States military again shot down an unidentified object over Alaska, using the most advanced American stealth jet, the F-22.	yes
击落的地点距离阿拉斯加海岸十英里。	The shootdown took place 10 miles off the coast of Alaska.	yes
这是美军在不到一周的时间里第二次击落空中飞行物体。	This was the second time the United States had shot down an aerial object in less than a week.	yes
上周六，来自中国的一个间谍气球在美国领空上漂移数日后在美国南卡罗莱纳州沿岸附近上空被击毁。	Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted in US airspace for days before it was destroyed near the US coast of South Carolina.	yes
五角大楼说，第二个被击落的物体于周四晚上首次进入美国领空，在阿拉斯加东北部上空移动时被美国军方跟踪，飞行高度为1.2万米（4万英尺），其大小与一辆小型汽车差不多，与先前被击落的那个中国间谍气球相比要小很多。	The Pentagon said the second downed object entered U.S. airspace for the first time on Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 metres (40,000 ft), about the size of a small car, and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.	yes
五角大楼还认为，目前没有迹象显示，这个物体是可操纵的。	The Pentagon also considered that there was currently no indication that the object was manipulable.	yes
白宫国家安全委员会战略沟通协调员约翰·科比周五表示，虽然这个在高空飞行的物体的具体样子尚不清楚，但它“对民航飞机的安全构成了合理的威胁”。	John Kirby, the White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Coordinator, said on Friday that while the exact nature of the high-altitude object is unknown, it "poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."	yes
科比表示，这个物体与美国境内发现的那个间谍气球不同，它上面没有悬挂“有效载荷”。	Kirby stated that the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, did not have a "payload" hanging from it.	yes
科比说，“我们把它称为一个‘物体’是我们目前能够作出的最好的描述”。	Kirby said, "What we call an 'object' is the best description we can make so far."	no
拜登总统在下令击落这个物体之前听取了五角大楼的建议，他作出这个决定的时候“非常谨慎”，科比补充说。	President Biden, who had listened to the Pentagon's advice before ordering the shooting down of the object, was "very careful" in making the decision, Kirby added.	no
美国官方对这个物体的描述大致可以归纳为：大小相当于一辆小汽车，没有操纵杆，没有悬挂装置，飞行高度为一万米左右。	The official U.S. description of the object can be roughly summarized as follows: it is about the size of a car, has no joystick, has no suspension, and flies at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.	no
但这些信息还无法回答基本问题，比如这个物体究竟是什么东西，它属于哪个国家，它在执行什么任务。	But this information does not yet answer basic questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what tasks it is carrying out.	no
目前网上许多的分析和猜测认为，这可能又是一只中国气球。	There is much analysis and speculation online that this may be another Chinese balloon.	no
它可能与入侵美国领空的那只间谍气球和在拉美上空飘动的那只中国气球一样都来自中国，它们在不同地点执行某种任务。	It is likely that, like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, it came from China and carried out some sort of mission in different locations.	no
也有人把阿拉斯加的这个“物体”与“不明飞行物”（UFO）联系在一起。	It has also been linked to the "UFO" in Alaska.	no
美国新闻周刊的报道引用美国前众议员彼得·梅杰（Peter Meijer）周五在推特上发出的推文说，“真希望这个‘不明飞行物’也是一个间谍气球，而不是一个合法的UFO”。	The report quoted former U.S. Representative Peter Meijer as saying on Twitter on Friday, "I wish this' UFO 'was also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO."	no
“将外星飞船与气象气球混为一谈的讽刺意味很令人惊讶，但这不值得引发一场星际冲突，”梅杰说。	"The irony of mixing an alien craft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth starting an interstellar conflict," said Major.	no
梅杰是在科比证实阿拉斯加的这个物体被击落之后不久发出这个推文的。	Major made the tweet shortly after Kirby confirmed that the Alaskan object had been shot down.	no
新闻周刊说，怀疑这个物体是UFO的不止是梅杰一人。	According to Newsweek, it was not just Major who suspected the object was a UFO.	no
田纳西共和党籍众议员蒂姆·伯切特（Tim Burchett）批评政府上个月的掩盖情报的做法，要求国家情报总监办公室 (DNI)公布有关“不明飞行物”的报告。	Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, criticized the government's efforts to conceal intelligence last month and asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on "UFOs."	no
亚马逊的客服态度让我难以相信	Amazon's customer service attitude makes me hard to believe	yes
估计很少有人看到这里，但是我也要稍微说一下。	I don & apos; t think many people have seen this, but I would like to say a few words.	yes
这件衣服当时我们购买的时候是一件拉链帽衫，最后送给我确是一件短袖。	It was a zipped hoodie when we bought it, and it was a short sleeve that I was given.	yes
收到衣服后立即与亚马逊客服取得了联系，当时确认衣服还是有库存的，我要求换货，客服说去解决一下，然后立即看到商品名称变成了短袖，原来我买的链接下架。	As soon as I received the clothes, I contacted Amazon customer service and confirmed that the clothes were still in stock, I asked for a replacement, the customer service said to fix it, and immediately saw that the product name had changed to a short sleeve, and the link I had bought had been removed.	yes
接着客服通知要么保留货品补偿一定金额，要么退货。	Then the customer service notice either keeps the goods for a certain amount of money or returns them.	yes
这就是亚马逊的处理方式？	Is this the Amazon approach?	yes
真的很难以置信，本身衣物发错并不是我的问题，作为一个消费者我要求获得我应获得的商品，并没有提出什么很夸张的要求，亚马逊却改名字，说无库存。	Believe it or not, it was not my fault that my clothes were faulty, and as a consumer I asked for the goods I was entitled to, without making any exaggerated demands, but Amazon changed its name and said that it had no stock.	yes
这是我的第一个长评，希望这不是我的最后一个。	This is my first long comment, and I hope it's not my last.	yes
让人无法理解的袖子	Incomprehensible sleeves	yes
说是牛皮的，也确实比较硬，但仔细看的话，局部有很多细小的裂痕，搞不清楚是否是真皮的，另外这个衣服的袖子真是让人无法理解，通常夹克的袖子要比衣摆长一些，不过通常也就1-2厘米，这件衣服足足长了5厘米，手臂自然下垂应该在手掌虎口的位置，但这件衣服的袖子都盖过手指了。	The sleeves of the jacket are usually longer than the sleeves of the jacket, but they are usually 1-2 cm long, and the arm should naturally hang in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of the jacket are covered with fingers.	yes
买衣服容易，退货也容易。	Clothing is easy to buy and easy to return.	yes
但是要退还钱真不知何时？	But when will the money be returned?	yes
衣服做工不错，因为版型偏小，只得退货，但是退了货以后，至今一个多星期过去了，还没有收到退款？	The clothes worked well, because the size was too small and had to be returned, but after the return, more than a week has passed and no refund has been received?	yes
而且要购买者自已和那个诚信度不怎么样的全峰快递联系，这是自购亚马逊的物品以来最糟糕的一次购物！	And the purchaser himself had to contact the untrustworthy Quanfeng courier, which was the worst purchase he had made since buying an Amazon item!	yes
但店家还是不错的，积极配合催促快递及时退款，但是这个全峰快递实在的工作是做的相当让人愤怒，拖拉半个月左右才退款，这种合作伙伴是要拖亚马逊的后腿的，工作效率差，没有服务意识！	But the store is still good, actively cooperate with the prompt courier to refund in time, but the real work of this Quanfeng courier is done quite angry, and it takes about half a month to refund, this partner is to drag the back of Amazon, work inefficiently, not service consciousness!	yes
更适合年轻人	Better for young people	yes
99秒杀的。	99 Seconds.	yes
毛裤的做工、颜色、手感都不错，柔软/薄厚适中，没有煤油味儿。	The color, texture, and texture of the trousers are good, soft and medium in thickness, and do not taste like kerosene.	yes
遗憾的是版型属于瘦型的，更适合年轻人。	Unfortunately, the form is thin and more suitable for young people.	yes
3XL，平铺腰围2尺5，拉伸最大尺寸4尺，1.79/80公斤穿着腰有点紧。	3 XL, with a tiled waist of 2 feet 5 inches, with a maximum stretch of 4 feet, 1.79 / 80 kg wearing a slightly tighter waist.	yes
似乎腰间没有松紧带，想加松点腰围还挺困难。	It seems that the waist is not tight, and it is difficult to increase the waist.	yes
另外，贴身穿是不舒服的。	In addition, the close-fitting clothing was uncomfortable.	yes
很好 颜色不是很鲜艳	Very good color is not very bright	yes
刚买就涨了两百多，这是什么情况。	More than two hundred of them were sold, which is what happened.	yes
第一次亚马逊用的合作的天天烂快递，第一次送货没在家，后来主动和快递员约了两次送货时间，那个快递员都不送，后来直接给我退货了，这个该死的快递员一点诚信也没有，强烈建议不要再用那个天天烂快递了。	The first time Amazon used a co-op courier, the first time delivery was not at home, then the initiative and the courier arranged two delivery times, the courier did not deliver, then returned it directly to me, the damned courier did not have any good faith at all, it is strongly recommended not to use that courier every day.	yes
这一次还有一件体恤衫也给我退货了，再拍也涨价了一百多元。	This time a T-shirt was also returned to me, and the price was raised by more than a hundred dollars.	yes
亚马逊自营不应该出现这样商品	Amazon itself should not appear such goods	yes
产品特价的时候购买，价格不低，看评论也是很不错的产品。	If the product is sold at a low price, it is also a good product.	yes
实际收到产品的时候让我目瞪口呆，商品表面大面积磨损，多处其他地方都有磨损，不是次品就是旧品，稍后上图。	I was stunned when I actually received the product, the surface of the product was worn out, there was wear in many other places, whether it was a defective product or an old one, as shown later.	yes
我申请退货，厂家的人看到图片后说是运输导致，这不是瞎说吗？	I asked for a return, and the manufacturer looked at the picture and said that it was the result of the shipment. Isn & apos; t that nonsense?	yes
商品内部怎么可能磨损？	How can the interior of a commodity be worn out?	yes
只有两种可能，要么次品旧品，要么就是我故意损坏商品，然后拿去退货。	There are only two possibilities, one is that the product is defective, the other that I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.	yes
客观来讲，我没有证据证明我没有损坏商品，但是以我在亚马逊购物的信用记录来讲，我认为这样的商品不应该出现在亚马逊自营商品中，客户选择亚马逊自营就是信任，customer win，we win，客户的胜利就是厂商的胜利，希望大家一起努力改进，谢谢。	Objectively, I have no proof that I have not damaged the product, but based on my credit history of shopping on Amazon, I do not think that such a product should appear in Amazon's own products, customer win, we win, customer win is the manufacturer's victory, thank you for your efforts to improve.	yes
我使用该产品不到一年，就出现两个E2，我不知道如何处理?	After less than a year of using the product, there were two E2s. I don't know what to do with them.	yes
我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?	I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the red E2 was often seen on the right side of the receiver, which should be a problem with the transmitter module, which is not consistent with the 7 years of continuous operation of the transmitter module on Amazon's website, and there is no aftermarket on Amazon's website, now I do not know what to do?	yes
还行吧	All right.	yes
第一次购买是坏的。	The first purchase was bad.	yes

换了以后好了。	"It's all right.	yes
换货挺迅速，晚上有点模糊，视角不是很广，但是普通家用够了。	The exchange is quick, the night is a bit blurry, the perspective is not very wide, but the ordinary household is enough.	yes
不足就是没有卡，自己买的，还有就是以前在亚马逊买过手机。	There is no need to buy a card, buy one yourself, or buy a cell phone from Amazon.	yes
包装上会有贴纸，防止包装被打开，这次没有，买手机时候还有个贴纸一样的章，可以贴在保修卡上，这次没有。	There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened, this time no, there is also a sticker like a sticker when buying a mobile phone, which can be attached to the warranty card, this time no.	yes
不知道是不是东西便宜了就没有，很困惑。	I don't know if it's cheap or not.	yes
等待供货商回复	Waiting for supplier response	yes
包装没有任何标识，直接给供货商致电说，回答没标识是正品，如怀疑可用边角料邮寄到强生公司验货，还留下车牌号以及电话号码，承诺会发短信通知把我的信息输入强生官网保修卡，到现在也没收到短信啊？	There is no sign on the package, call the supplier directly and say that the answer is not marked as genuine, such as suspected scrap mail to Johnson & amp; Johnson inspection, leave the license plate number and phone number, promise to send a text message to enter my information into the Johnson & amp; Johnson warranty card, and have not received a text message yet?	yes

支持星冠，支持胜牌，对车有效保护。	Support for the Star Crown, support for the winning card, and effective protection for the car.	yes
日本亚马逊因为客服问题导致买家的利益严重受损（8c的毛毛虫发货为8cm的毛毛虫）（8c=14cm，8cm=2c）	Amazon in Japan seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service problems (8c caterpillars shipped as 8cm caterpillars) (8c = 14cm, 8c = 2c)	yes
承认错误，但是一直在推诿，始终强调货物为第三方，不能约束第三方。	Admitting the error, but always prevaricating, always emphasizing that the goods were third parties and could not bind them.	yes
订单编号：503-4265464-1830254。	Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.	yes
我当初购买的页面尺码选项为7c，8，9c，当时觉得这就是个陷阱，打电话给日亚中文客服，明确告知8就是8c，但是等商品回到中国才发现，只有8cm，我觉得这完全是故意设下的陷阱来坑中国人（按照亚马逊的售后），现在查看页面已没有这个选项。	When I bought the page size options 7c, 8c, and 9c, I thought it was a trap, called Nichia's customer service and told them clearly that 8c was 8c, but when the product came back to China, I found that it was only 8cm, which I thought was just a deliberate trap set to trap the Chinese (according to Amazon's after-sales service).	yes
中方客服：很抱歉，给你带来损失了，我们给你两条路走：	Chinese customer service: I am sorry, we have caused you a loss, we have given you two ways:	yes
1，你退货，买家承担所有运费。	1. You return the goods, and the buyer bears all the shipping costs.	yes
2，你不退货，我们补偿你1000日元。	If you do not return it, we will reimburse you 1,000 yen.	yes
（我算一下账，鞋子4000多日元，算作200rmb，选择1，我没有鞋子，损失在200元。	(I checked the account, shoes 4000 yen, 200 rmb, choice 1, I do not have shoes, I lost 200 yuan.)	yes
选择2，我有鞋子，最后补偿了我2000日元，最后损失在150rmb 客服：我们已记录下来，我们会认真处理，次日回了封邮件，说我不接受中方客服调解，就这么完了。	The second option, I have shoes, finally compensated me 2,000 yen, finally lost at 150 rmb customer service: We have recorded it, we will take it seriously, the next day I returned to the mail, saying that I do not accept Chinese customer service mediation, and that's it.	yes
我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	When I suggested the confusing option of buying pages 7c, 8c, and 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me by saying that Japanese common codes do not carry c, like 140, but did you go to any other caterpillar pages?	yes
都有美码，日码混标的情况出现。	There is a common misconception that there is a common misconception.	no
再说，你8cm为什么放在7c和9c中间，明明最小的尺码，你放那里算什么意思。	Also, why do you put 8 cm between 7c and 9c, and what do you mean by the smallest size?	no
中方客服：我们提供中文服务，但是不知道你要运回国，所以你的运费我们是不予理赔的。	Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we do not know that you are going to return home, so we do not pay for your freight.	no
这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	I don't understand this logic anymore, I'm Japanese, I want Chinese customer service, China living in Japan does not need Chinese customer service, I go to Japan as a tourist, I don't have that kind of kung fu to call international long distance, then the question comes, who needs to call Amazon overseas to buy Chinese phone, it's nothing like me.	no
亚马逊中文客服不就是方便了我们海淘的这些人吗？	Didn't Amazon's Chinese customer service make it easier for those of us on the Internet?	no
这次购买不是很满意	This purchase is not very satisfactory	yes
这是第二次从亚马逊上购买帮宝适尿布，曾经在宝宝2个月的时候买过一箱，选择了欧洲进口纸张的尿布，第一次购买经历还是比较满意的，宝宝整夜就用一张尿布，的确可以满足12个小时不换尿布。	This was the second time that Pampers diapers had been purchased from Amazon, having bought a box of diapers from European paper when the baby was two months old, and the first purchase was satisfactory, as the baby used a diaper all night and did not change the diaper for 12 hours.	yes
但是这次购买L号的尿布，一箱里面有2包分开包装，打开后就觉得纸张比较松，跟进口帮宝适有明显区别，给宝宝用了之后，还算可以，没有漏尿也没有红疹等迹象。	For example, in the case of the "L" diaper, there are two separate bags of diapers, and when the bag is opened, it is felt that the paper is looser than it should be, and there is no sign of a rash or urine leak after it has been used for babies.	yes
但是到了第二包尿布，开始使用后宝宝的大腿内侧立马就出现了红疹，至今还没有褪去。	However, after the second diaper bag, the baby's inner thigh developed a red rash, which has not yet subsided.	yes
怀疑1箱里面的2包，质量还不一样啊。	There are two cases where the quality is not the same.	yes
以后应该不会继续购买了！	No more purchases should be made!	yes
希望重视包裹的运输保护	I want to pay attention to the transport protection of the package	yes
这是我网购这么久以来，看到最差的一次包装运输，完全没有什么保护措施，缓冲泡沫，包裹缓冲层材料等，什么都没有。	It was the worst package shipment I've seen in a long time, with no protection at all, no cushioning foam, no parcels of cushioning material, nothing.	yes
就一个压变形的箱子。	A box of compressed deformation.	yes
而且里面的软胶盒包装的，卡盒都压开了压到变形了。	Also, the soft plastic box inside is packed, and the card box is pressed open until it is deformed.	yes
希望是正品 质量有保证，以后是不怎么敢亚马孙买东西的了。	The quality of the product is guaranteed, and it is no longer possible to purchase anything from Amazonia.	yes
宁愿国内贵一半，有保障点。	It would be better to have half the domestic cost and have a point of security.	yes
而且商品产品包装问题，我看评论2016年就有人评论过，到现在19年，还是老样子。	And the packaging of commodities, as I see it, was commented on in 2016, 19 years now, is still the same.	yes
说明亚马逊根本就不重视服务反馈这一块，和国内的京东、天猫等差太远了。	It is important to note that Amazon does not pay much attention to service feedback, and it is far from being home to the likes of Jingdong and Tmall.	yes
好看，但有点点小遗憾	Pretty, but a little sorry	yes
整个杯子的颜色是我狠喜欢的，橘红色，虽然我家是男宝，但是还是觉得橘红配黄色很亮眼。	The color of the cup is my favorite, orange, although my family is a man's treasure, but I think that orange and yellow are bright.	yes
比我想象的小一些，不过本来就是拿来带出门用的，所以还可以接受。	It was smaller than I thought, but it was supposed to be brought out, so it was acceptable.	yes
昨晚拿回家试了一下，瓶盖推开之后，吸管和盖子之间的距离太近了，因为吸管的位置是正向垂直的，所以儿子总是要把盖子上面的凸起含住喝水，觉得这个地方是否可以改进一下。	When he returned home last night and tried it, the cap was pushed open, and the distance between the straw and the lid was too close, because the position of the straw was perpendicular to the top of the cap, so the son always had to hold the top of the lid and drink water, thinking that the place could be improved.	yes
看来其他牌子的吸管杯把吸管做的倾斜还是有道理的，小孩子的东西，真的就是在乎安全和舒适。	It seems that other brands of suction cups still make sense to tilt the straws, and children's things are really about safety and comfort.	yes
轻便大容量	Lightweight, large capacity	yes
喜欢它轻便，开口大，就是两个独立的分隔袋对我来说有点多余，感觉不知道装什么好。	I like it because it's light, it's big, it's two separate pockets, it's kind of superfluous for me, I don't know what to put in.	yes
买完发现海外购美亚上还有一只另一个牌子很类似的，才不到两百块。	It was found that there was another similar brand on the overseas purchase of the United States of America, which was worth less than two hundred dollars.	yes
假货，假的特别厉害	Fake, especially fake	yes
亚马逊卖假货，我也是服了。	Amazon sells fakes, and I wear them.	yes
客服说因为用了所以不能退货，我没用怎么知道是假货。	The customer service said they could not return it because it was used, and I did not know how to know that it was a fake.	yes
因为信任，所以伤心，毕竟是抹脸的用品，真的去实体店买吧，认可贵一点。	In the end, it turns out to be a good idea to buy something, to buy it, to buy it, to buy it.	yes
因为是秒杀，所以没有看评论，我已经提交国家工商总局的电商平台了，我们一起维权吧。	As a result of this, I have no choice but to submit it to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform.	yes
坏了？	Bad?	yes
假货？	Fake?	yes
总之悲剧。	In short, tragedy.	yes
用第二片的时候选的毛孔细致的，但是一打开就一股怪味，以为是正常的，因为没用过这款，然后往脸上贴的时候就整个受不了了，非常冲的味道，无法形容，熏到立马咳嗽了出来，眼睛也很痛，流眼泪，马上摘了去洗脸。	This is the first time that a person has been shown to have a strong sense of smell, but it is also the second time that a person has been shown to have a strong sense of smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, etc.	yes

回想起有点像发廊里劣质烫发水的味道。	It's a little bit like the smell of poor-quality scalding water.	yes
真无法想象，难倒亚马逊自营的护肤品从此也得避而远之了吗？	Is it unthinkable that Amazon's own skincare products will have to be avoided?	yes
奸商啊	What a mess.	yes
当时购买的时候，活动页面上是说满99元赠送“三体全集”，收到货没有这个赠品，打客服电话说要给他们看当时活动的截图，问题是谁买东西还把网页截图保存啊，你们自己做过的活动，还需要顾客帮你们提供啊，各位买家下次要留个心眼，保存证据。	In this case, the customer would be asked to pay $100 for the service, and the customer would be asked to pay $100 for the service, and the customer would be asked to pay $100 for the service, and the customer would be asked to pay $100 for the service, and the customer would be asked to pay $100 for the service.	yes
用后感受	Feeling after use	yes
第一次在亚马逊买东西，分别感受有几点，先来说下用完商品的感受吧，第一确实是无痛，也没有刺激味道的东西，总体来说很不错的，静等8分钟左右一擦就掉了，只是会有少量的汗毛渣在上面，不细看是看不出来的，所以说总体是不错的，至于之后都就用一次还要继续观察，继续用才会知道。	For the first time in the history of the world, there is no doubt that it was the first time in the history of the world that a person was born, and that he was born, and that it was the first time in his life that he was born, and that it was the first time in his life that he was born, and that it was the first time in his life that he was born, and that he never died.	yes
反正我觉得这个东西确实不错。	Anyway, I think this is really good.	yes
第二从27号下单，12号收到货，总共15天也就是半个月，亚马逊的送货员服务态度也很好。	The second order was placed from number 27 and received in number 12 for a total of 15 days or half a month, and Amazon's delivery service was excellent.	yes
第三，亚马逊的什么黑色星期五就不要相信了，星期五下单，等了2天就便宜了接近12块钱，也就是我买成170多（加上运费什么的），有一种搞活动就提价格的感觉样。	Third, don't believe in a black Friday on Amazon, and place an order on Friday and wait for two days to get close to $12, which means I buy more than 170 (plus shipping and so on).	yes
客服说什么价格波动，我关注了10多天价格也就是这个样，波动也不大的。	What the customer service said about the price fluctuation, I focused on the price for more than 10 days just like that, and the fluctuation was small.	yes
价格实惠，日原产，有中文标签，带颗粒，绝对回购！	Affordable, made in Japan, labelled in Chinese, with granules, absolutely buy back!	yes
膏体里带颗粒的，清爽感恰到好处，用后牙齿爽滑，上比某二手东强太多啦，那里说是进口的东西，可好多东西没有中文标签，不知从哪里批发的。	There are a number of different types of teeth, some of which are very smooth, some of which are slightly thicker than the rest of the teeth, and some of which are slightly thicker than the rest of the teeth.	yes
以后只要亚马逊有的，绝不再去二手东。	As a result, Amazon will no longer be able to sell its products.	yes
给个建议，亚马逊的app 上晒单怎么有时晒不了，希望能改进一些应用，会做的越来越好的！	To give you some advice on how Amazon's apps can sometimes get sunburned, how to improve some apps, how to do better and better!	yes
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	Excellent years, getting worse, no quality of service at all!	yes
垃圾卓越不顾及客户需求 下订单的时候特别配送时间19:00-22:00。	Special delivery time 19: 00-22: 00 when placing an order regardless of customer needs.	yes
因家里有术后卧床不方便的老人在，所以只有晚上可以方便收件。	It is only at night when there are elderly people in the house who are inconvenient to sleep in after surgery.	yes
结果竟然中午12点就直接上门送了，也不事先电话告知。	As a result, it was delivered directly to the door at 12 o'clock, without any advance notice by telephone.	yes
如果配送时间是你们快递员随心所欲的想几点就几点送，何必假惺惺弄个时间让客户选择？	If the delivery time is as short as your courier wants, why take the time to let the customer choose?	yes
如果自己的物流没办法保证服务的，那就干脆不要做电商了！	If their own logistics can not guarantee the service, then simply do not become an electricity supplier!	yes

从头到底也没有人来电话联系一下给个解释！	No one called to explain!	yes
卓越网所谓的投诉客服就是一帮子外地人在那里装样子，敷衍你的投诉然后给你一个所谓的答复。	The so-called complaint service is a group of outsiders who pretend to be there, amplify your complaint and then give you a so-called reply.	yes
不会有任何改变或者补偿！	There will be no change or compensation!	no
之前也是遇到这样子了类似配送时间不对的问题也就忍了，但这次无法忍受，太过分了！	I've had this kind of problem with delivery times before, but this time it's too much!	no
新书买的预售到货后竟然封面和封底是反的，这样子明显得质量问题就这样子闭眼把书发给顾客了？	After the sale of the new book, the front cover and back cover are reversed, so it is obvious that the quality of the book will be closed to the customer.	no

不会再在卓越上花一毛钱。	No more spending a dime on excellence.	no
图片质量实在不能接受	Image quality is really unacceptable	yes
作为“古地图集”这样的标题，本书在图片的选择、排版、印刷上实在令人难以接受，有些图片甚至有马赛克，模糊到无法辨识。	As a title such as "Ancient Atlas," the book is difficult to accept in terms of the selection, layout, and printing of the images, some of which are even mosaics, blurred to the point of being unrecognizable.	yes
即便本书不是专业的地图册，即便是小画幅插图，也应该对得起目录中祖先留下来的洋洋大观的中古文献资料！	Even if the book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small illustration, it should be worthy of the magnificent ancient documents left by the ancestors in the catalogue!	yes
（况且很多图片是可以从相关行业资源中获取清晰的原始文件的），用这样的图片来拼凑图书与不使用图片有何差别？	(And many of the images can be obtained from relevant industry sources with clear raw documents.) What is the difference between piecing together a book with such images and not using them?	yes
！我为这样的治学精神感到遗憾。	I'm very sorry for that kind of academic attitude.	yes
文字方面不予评价，方家各有分辨。	There is no way to tell the difference between the two.	yes
整体2星。	2 stars.	yes
高二的时候看的这本书当时只是抱着无聊看看玩的心态，感觉这样的书自己应该不会沉迷吧，毕竟起点的网文以往还是不太吸引我的。	The second book I read in high school was just a boring look at the state of mind, and I felt that the book itself should not be addicted to it, after all, the beginning of the Internet was not very attractive to me.	yes
然后...就掉坑里了。	And then... it fell into the pit.	yes
按着这个剧情来说，整本书都是比较轻松愉快的，前部分叶修还在网游里的时候，即使是公会之间勾心斗角，也因为往往被叶神狗血，搞得一点也不沉重。	The book is generally considered to be the best book of the series, as it was written in the early days of the comic book series, although it is not as well known as the first book in the series.	yes
至于到了比赛的部分，写出了时代的变迁新旧交替的一点点心酸之感（可能是我多愁善感）。	As for the part of the game, I wrote a little bittersweet feeling of the change of the times between the old and the new (probably my sentimentality).	yes
看整部书花了我高二许多学习时间，可是就是停不下来。	It took me a lot of time to read the book, but I couldn't stop.	yes
全职对人物和感情线的描写让人十分惊艳，有的人物只是偶尔带过，也会给人留下很深的影响，像比较重点描写的角色叶修黄少天苏沐橙都有大量的粉丝，而不在写作中心的角色例如江波涛楚云秀等等也十分找人喜欢，在一个电竞的爽文中竟然让人找不到一个让人讨厌至极的人物，这是全职在人物描写上的成功。	The characters are often portrayed in a way that makes them feel like they are in the right place, and the characters are often portrayed in a way that makes them feel like they are in the right place at the right time, such as when they are in the right place at the right time, or when they are in the wrong place at the right time, such as when they are in the wrong place.	yes
而在感情线上，全职也没有一般网文所令人诟病的后宫佳丽三千万要么美女要么腐的毛病，全文所有人的感情，都有一个共同的地方就是他们喜欢着荣耀这个游戏，并且大都想要堂堂正正的胜利。	On the other hand, there is no such thing as a full time job on the Internet, which is generally criticized as 30 million or more beautiful or corrupt, and the feelings of all of them have one thing in common: they like to glorify the game, and most want to win.	yes
小计量有却没有什么大阴谋，每个人看上去都那么单纯可爱。	There is no big conspiracy, and everyone looks so simple and cute.	yes
这或许也是为什么全职没有什么令人讨厌的角色。	Perhaps that is why there is no annoying role to play full-time.	yes
全职的IP很大，也归功于此。	Full-time IP is big, thanks to that.	yes
撇开网文这个文化现象不谈，全职不失为一本不错的书。	Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of the Internet, a full-time job is a good book.	no
多少他真的会给人提供一些热血，一点点感动。	How much he really gives people some hot blood, a little touched.	no
今年4月份全职要动漫化。	In April of this year, full time will be animated.	no
其实想要买齐这套书很久了，碍于永远钱包不够厚都没狠下心下手，然后想要买的时候就发现，tb上简直是假货猖獗，其实全职最近出了另一个版本，封面图吧我自己是蛮喜欢的，但还是打算先买老的版本，所以就在亚马逊上看了看，一次性买下来了一套。	In fact, I've been trying to buy this book for a long time, because it's not always thick enough, and when I wanted to buy it, I found that it was a fake on tb, but in fact, a full-time recent version has come out, and I like the cover picture, but I'm going to buy the old version first, so I looked at it on Amazon and bought it at once.	no
接下来简单说一下货的情况。	Then briefly talk about the situation of the goods.	no
●第四本的塑封没有，但书是新的。	The fourth book has no seal, but the book is new.	no
●第十七本塑封是在但是被打开了，书的质感也很奇怪感觉没有其他的硬。	In the 17th century, there was a need for a new style of writing, but this was not the case in the 19th century.	no
●第23本和第十七本情况一样，但是也比第十七本硬，但十分的旧。	:: The 23rd book is the same as the 17th book, but it is also harder than the 17th book, but very old.	no
●个别几本书的出版社不同好像第23和17就是同一个出版社，和其他的不同。	:: The publishers of individual books are different, as if 23 and 17 were the same publisher, and different from others.	no
●整体来讲还算满意，24本很大一箱，很满足。	:: Overall satisfactory, 24 boxes, very satisfactory.	no
落寞的小狮子	The Lonely Lion	yes
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner," and the result was a lot of text!	yes
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	After reading the book three times, he read it to the children, a little lion who can shoot, and a little lion who loves juice candy.	yes
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	When the lion eats the hunter, it is a little uncomfortable, and the modern city people do not accept this arrangement of eating animals.	yes
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	In the end, the lion, who had succeeded in human society, lost himself and was no longer a full lion or a full man.	yes
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	In the end, only the back of the lion remains, and it is not known where he went.	yes
可能多年以后，这个小狮子的形象还留在长大了的小朋友的印象中，在某一天不经意的时候被想起，或许对她会有触动或是启发。	Perhaps years later, the image of the lion remains in the memory of a grown child, who may be touched or inspired by an inadvertent recollection of her one day.	yes
性价比很高的作品集	Cost-effective collection of works	yes
1、以前还不知道TASCHEN，最近买了不少他们的书，原因就是太强悍，不论是选题还是制作本身。	I don't know if it was the first time, but I think it was the first time that I was able to do that, and I think it was the first time that I was able to do that.	yes
本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	The largest edition, like the complete Michelangelo collection, is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the middle edition is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this edition is the smallest of the two, with a book box.	yes
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	It was also acceptable, as it was cheaper and more than 700 pages split into two, which could be easily read as a paperback edition; secondly, unlike the complete Michelangelo collection, which was dominated by paintings, the manuscript in black and white by Leonardo da Vinci was the majority, and the edition was the best value for money as an appreciation of the paintings and manuscripts for budget-constrained, non-art readers.	yes
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	The painting part of the explanation is excellent, there is composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I do not know whether it is printing or book size problem, some of the shadow parts are too deep, I can not see the details, I am a little sorry.	yes
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	In contrast to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer.	yes
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius, the latter is a wide range of achievements, is not enough to be a genius.	yes
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	If only half of the Leonardo da Vinci paintings had been seen, the manuscript would have been completely lost in language.	yes
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Garbage, who buys it and repents!	yes
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	Never give a bad opinion, this real garbage, buy a waste of money, give a reason!	yes

快递太差，亚马逊上买东西本来就慢，没想到会这么慢！	Courier delivery is so bad that Amazon is already slow to buy things, and I didn't expect it to be so slow!	yes
总体满意	Overall satisfactory	yes
之前一开始还担心相机的包装，这次还好，里面有充气包，相机三码一致，也能在官网注册，快门次数0，其余的就只能等时间检验了 。	In the beginning, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, this time it was fine, there was an inflatable bag inside, the camera was consistent, it was also possible to register on the official website, the number of fast doors 0, the rest can only wait for the time to check.	yes
发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	It was not long before I heard the sound of the door opening, and I could not help but feel that the door was open, and that the door was open, and that I could not open it in front of him.	yes
商家发货前做到了为客户着想:)	Merchant before shipping for the sake of the customer:)	yes
商家比较负责，专门打电话问所用相机的屏幕尺寸，确实替客户着想了。	The business was more responsible, calling specifically to ask for the screen size of the camera used, and indeed for the customer & apos; s sake.	yes
发货速度也快。	Delivery is also fast.	yes
金刚膜贴上去也挺合适和管用的。	It is also a good place to start.	yes
电池充不满	Battery charge dissatisfaction	yes
机器确实不错，想问下怎么第一次充电起就充不满啊，充电指示灯一直红色	The machine is really good, I want to ask how to charge for the first time, I am dissatisfied, the charging indicator is red	yes
目前找不到亚马逊官方反馈渠道，所以只能在商品评价里反馈	There is currently no official Amazon feedback channel, so feedback can only be provided in product reviews.	yes
1. 在 3 月 29 号，通过预购途径使用 31 元购买了此书，显示 3 月 31 号会推送到设备上，此时亚马逊官网上还无法预览该书（因为还未发布）；	1. On March 29, the book was purchased for $31 through pre-order, indicating that the March 31 issue would be pushed to the device, at which time the book could not be previewed on Amazon's official website (as it had not yet been released).	yes
2. 3 月 31 号推送到设备上的书，内容是空白，只有敬请期待，而亚马逊上该书电子版降价到了 18 元；	2. The book, which was sent to the device on March 31, is blank and only to be expected, while the electronic version of the book on Amazon has been reduced to $18;	yes
3. 这两天反复尝试将设备上的下载的空白的书进行删除，再次同步，都无法获取到包含实际内容的电子版《商业的本质》，但是看到亚马逊官网已经可以预览该书。	In the second half of the book, it is revealed that the book is not available on Amazon's official website, but is available on Amazon's official website.	yes
目前我有几点感想	Now I have a few thoughts.	yes
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	The question of the price is not really the most important, the key is how to replace a blank book on the kindle with a book with actual content, instead of downloading it forever.	yes
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	2. The books purchased in advance should not be purchased again, after all, in the event that a ticket is skipped and a book with an empty content is downloaded, the procedure appears to be very complicated;	yes
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	For example, if you have a question about an e-book download, or if you have a question about the use of an e-book download, you can give a local feedback (either a ticket or online customer service, see how the Microsoft Store works).	yes
不是很推荐阅读	Not very recommended to read	yes
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it after reading it with my memory.	yes
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	The book is not a collection of short stories, but rather a collection of fragments of life's love.	yes
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The book's tone is extremely plain, like that of boiling water, and the words are the ultimate pursuit of simplicity, and the plot is as quiet as the streets of summer afternoons.	yes
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Each short story is a brief sketch of ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.	yes
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	The final collection was titled "What We're Talking About When We Talk About Love."	yes
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I think that this collection of novels, and its title, like a kind of performance art, the author wants to express that love is not only a sad discord on the stage, a dry stone in the urban legend, but also a love that is not only above but should not be represented, love is also a life as flat as water, boring day after day, there is also a uncertainty about life, reality escape, and the future.	yes
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	When you read the book, you may think of a couple quarreling next to you, an awkward marriage with someone you know, and an unhappy feeling.	yes
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	That's why I don't recommend reading it, and from an aesthetic point of view, the writing and the plot are boring, and unless your life is stormy or sweet enough to live in a candy castle, you have to read it as if you were bored. "	yes
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	And, in terms of the depth of thought, the everyday plot does not brighten or expand one's thinking and perspective (unlike Márquez's Love in the Cholera), and the short clip does not explore any issues, such as what mistakes led to the failure of love?	yes
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?	no
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much sense to read it or not.	no
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	The author's ideas are expressed through techniques and genres rather than storylines, which explains the poor reading experience of the book.	no
适合粗读,不能细看。	Suitable for rough reading, can not take a closer look.	yes
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	The logic of the book is good, but the content is not plentiful.	yes
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	A lot of sales theory is explained what and why, but in terms of how to do it is very weak, just pointed out the direction but do not give specific practice.	yes
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	In addition, the book feels like a patchwork.	yes
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	Examples include both domestic and foreign; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and unknown people.	yes
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	It is not known whether the story was compiled for the sake of example, but it would be more convincing to cite some of the authors & apos; personal experiences.	yes
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	In the customer or the name of the customer to change.	yes
标题上还是顾客,正文中就变成客户了。	The title is still the customer, the text becomes the customer.	yes
电子书中还出现了错别字、标点符号缺失、编号错误的问题。	There are also problems with typos, missing punctuation, and incorrect numbering in e-books.	yes
总之,这本书作为理论入门是个不错的选择,但对于已经从事销售工作想要提高销售水平的人就不太适用了。	In short, this book is a good introduction to theory, but it is not suitable for those who are already in sales and want to improve their sales.	yes
快速了解互联网金融的导读书	A quick introduction to Internet Finance	yes
这本书很浅，可以说只是一个入门课，可以帮助大家快速了解互联网金融的全貌，但要深入了解，还是要按图索骥，自己去深挖。	The book is shallow and can be said to be just an introductory course that can help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but if you want to know more about it, you have to find it and dig it yourself.	yes
且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	In addition, the book was written earlier, and the content of the later Alipay WeChat to cultivate user habits through the subsidy war has not yet been mentioned, and the third party payment share is not as small as it is said in the book.	yes
现在好多人外出吃饭都是带个手机就好，商家也因为银行流水太高的原因，弃用银联了。	Many of the people who went out to eat had to bring a mobile phone, and the bank had to abandon the use of UnionPay due to the high cost of the bank.	yes
但还是非常感谢作者写出这本入门书，看得出作者起码有多年的金融观察经验，对国内外的金融发展史都十分熟悉，所以才能写成如此通俗易懂的内容。	However, it is also important to note that the author of the book is very knowledgeable about the history of financial development both in Japan and abroad, as he has at least many years of experience in financial observation, so he is able to write such easy-to-understand content.	yes
写高大空很容易，难的是写的通俗易懂。	It is easy to write and easy to understand.	yes
欣赏你，更想让你知道！	Admire you, and let you know!	yes
决定一个人工作满意度的第一要素不是薪水高低，而是在工作中是否得到了足够重视和赏识。	The first factor in determining a person's job satisfaction is not the level of pay, but whether or not they are sufficiently valued and appreciated at work.	yes
根据马斯洛需求层次理论，在人的基本生存需要得到满足后，最迫切的就是心理需要的满足——希望被理解、被肯定、被赏识。	According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, after a person's basic survival needs have been met, the most pressing need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.	yes
确实，对于国人来说，大部分是“爱你在心口难开”，即便是怀有爱、感激与赞赏也是默默放在心里不会说出来。	Indeed, for most people, it is "hard to love you in your heart," and even with love, gratitude, and appreciation, it is silently unspoken.	yes
作者在本书中阐述了五种赞赏的语言：肯定的言辞、精心时刻、服务的行为、称心的礼物、身体接触。	In the book, the author describes five types of language of appreciation: positive words, careful moments, acts of service, gifts of gratification, and physical contact.	yes
我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	What I think is important is not that you know what the five languages are, but that you can appreciate them from the bottom of your heart, anytime, anywhere, and be grateful to those around you, whether they be family, friends, or colleagues.	yes
其实越是亲密的人越需要赞赏和感恩，这样我们的生活才会变得更加美好。	The closer we are, the more appreciative and grateful we are, and the better our lives will be.	yes
学会赞赏，企业也能在一定程度上挽留住人才，降低辞职率。	The Society also appreciates the extent to which companies can retain talent and reduce the rate of resignations.	yes
感谢译者给我们带来了精彩的国外的思想和世界。	Thanks to the translators who brought us wonderful foreign ideas and the world.	yes
由于中西方文化背景等原因，语言之间或多或少会存在差异，如果有机会能看到作者原版相信会收获更多。	Due to the cultural differences between the two languages, it is believed that the authors of the original texts would have gained more if they had had a chance to see them.	yes
再次谢谢作者和译者以及编辑们的辛勤劳动！	Again, thank you to the authors, translators and editors for their hard work!	no
疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	Suspected of counterfeit goods, review them carefully.	yes
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	Super poor quality, loose packaging, no weight, even worse than roadside stalls, no weight, no bar code, ten bags of packaging is also loose, completely not the characteristics of qualified products; Amazon's worst shopping experience, has applied for a return; is a matter of quality; advises merchants to polish their eyes and refuse inferior goods; Supplement: bought another heart print, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 rolls, added a few comparative photos to further verify the falsity of the product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic loss and further discomfort!	yes
再度期望亚马逊能够一丝不苟，严把商品源头。	Once again, Amazon is expected to be meticulous about the source of its products.	yes
马马虎虎的产品，和期望有差距	There is a gap between slack products and expectations	yes
优点：	Advantages:	yes
1. 大品牌，价格便宜。	1. Big brand, cheap price.	yes
优点2：电机和刀片都是PANASONIC保证的，使用起来也还OK，但是和我期望有差距。	Advantage 2: Both the motor and blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC and are OK to use, but there is a gap with my expectations.	yes
缺点：	Disadvantage:	yes
1. 充电没有指示灯，这个最基本你的电源指示都省下了，估计购买300元产品的客户，在松下PANASONIC的眼里，也是施舍，毫无尊重。	There is no charge indicator, and the most basic of your power instructions are omitted, and the customer who buys the estimated $300 product is also a charity in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC.	yes
2. 有强烈的异味 充电时候，哪怕仅仅充电10分钟，就可以闻到强烈的塑胶燃烧的那种味道。	When charged with a strong odor, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, it can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.	yes
办公室试用了1天，搞的全屋子都是这种塑胶味道。	One day, the whole room was filled with plastic.	yes
和我之前用过的同价位的飞利浦PHILIPS相比，虽然多了个刀头，但是松下这款产品，质量真是对不起消费者了。	Compared to the Philips PHILIPS of the same price range that I used before, this product, Panasonic, the quality is really sorry for the consumer.	yes
小包装	Small packaging	yes
收到快递一看上面写着电商版就知道又掉坑里了，比超市买的小了好些，应该是M，跟商品介绍上面的图片包装不一样，所谓新版吧。	It is also possible to see that the product is more or less identical to the original product, and that the product is more or less the same as the original product.	yes
三颗星是怪自己马虎没看清楚商品规格，你卖M码电商版我没意见，你货不对版是几个意思？	"'복면가왕' 동방신기, 3 주연속 1 위... 이상수상수상, 이상수상수상."	yes
电商套路深，有时间还是去超市买了。	The store has a long history of selling and selling goods to supermarkets.	yes
就酱紫。	The Purple Sauce.	yes
味道不喜欢	I don't like it.	yes
小孩很不喜欢牙膏的味道，每次都说辣，也许用别的词形容才更贴切，小孩的词库里暂时只有这个词。	The children do not like the taste of toothpaste, and each time it is hot, it may be better described by another word, which is temporarily the only word in the child's vocabulary.	yes
搞活动时候买的，很便宜，所以也不好意思给差评了，四星吧，不过不会再买了。	It's a good idea to buy four stars, but they're not going to buy any more.	yes
正品哟 包装好	This is a good idea.	yes
包装很完整，里面加了充气袋，没有网上评论的只有光秃秃一个产品的样子。	The packaging is complete, with an inflatable bag inside, and there is no online review except for the bare appearance of a product.	yes
瓶子外包装上还有一层塑料膜像图片上描述的一样，快递也很快，拍下第二天就来了。	There was also a layer of plastic film on the bottle's outer packaging, as shown in the picture, and the courier was quick to arrive the next day.	yes
是正品，只是没货了，不知道什么时候再上架。	It is not known when it was sold, but it is known when it was sold.	yes
糟心的一次购物体验	A terrible shopping experience	yes
黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	For example, in the case of a person who has been in a relationship for more than five years, the relationship between the relationship and the relationship between the husband and wife, the relationship between the husband and wife, the relationship between the husband and wife, the relationship between the husband and wife, the relationship between the husband and wife, the relationship between the husband and wife, the relationship between the husband and the wife, the relationship between the husband and the wife, the relationship between the husband and the wife, and the relationship between the husband and the wife.	yes
错误的配图	Wrong layout	yes
我以为自己能够收到图1这样的耳机，没想到却收到了图2这样的耳机，图物不一致也就算了，耳机左右声音大小不一又是什么意思？	I thought I would receive a headphone like Figure 1, but I received a headphone like Figure 2. What does it mean if the figures are not consistent?	yes
虽然名称都是一样的，但还是希望大家能够小心注意，另外还请亚马逊负责人及时更换正确的配图，万分感谢。	Although the names are the same, I hope that you will be careful and ask Amazon to change the correct layout in time, thank you very much.	yes
操作系统一般般	Operating system General	yes
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	For a while, the overall picture was fine, and I didn't feel any difference, except that the system was tangled, booting time was obviously a bit slow, and the software that came with it didn't have to be commented on, and the response was more general, and it wasn't an order of magnitude better than that of my colleagues.	yes
看评论说很人性化的设计，我没有找到哪里人性化，遥控器这个常用的上下左右，返回键设计的位置实在是不敢恭维。	When I look at the reviews, it's a very human design, I don't find where I'm humanized, and the remote control, which is usually up and down and left and right, returns to the position of the key design is really not flattering.	yes
所以呢，就当个电视吧，再外加电视盒之类的用吧。	So, just be a TV, add a TV box and so on.	yes
降价太厉害了	The price reduction is too great	yes
降价太厉害了，一百多入现在99！	The price has dropped so much that it is now 99!	yes
在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	A lot of unreviewed orders have accumulated on Amazon, so I use a copy of the same passage as a review.	yes
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I use this phrase in my evaluation, it means that the product has a score of at least 85.	yes
而比较差的产品，我绝对不会偷懒到复制粘贴评价，这样其他消费者在购买的时候会作为参考，而商家也会因此改进商品质量。	I would never be too lazy to copy and paste a bad product, so that other consumers can use it as a reference when they buy it, and so that the seller can improve the quality of the product.	yes
低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	Good line, no fever is enough!	yes
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	Such a cheap line, but it should meet the hdmi certification standard, personally compare the killing domestic Akihabara these dog-farting toys (the price is twice as expensive), the wire body is thick, soft, 7 meters transmission without noise, later the low line is considered to be double!	yes
东西还可以，但是亚马逊的售后服务真的比其他网站差太多了	Something is fine, but Amazon's after-sales service is really far worse than other websites.	yes
下单后发现下错了，但是取消订单已经取消不了，网页联系在线客服一直显示错误链接，联系不上。	After the order was placed, it was discovered that a mistake had been made, but the order could not be cancelled, and the website contact online customer service always displayed the wrong link and could not be contacted.	yes
到货后送货员给我打电话，我说我不要了，想取消订单的没取消成功，派送员就拿回去了，说先给我签收上，让我申请退货。	The delivery man called me, and I said I didn't want it, and the person who wanted to cancel the order didn't succeed, so the delivery man took it back and said he'd sign it and ask me to return it.	yes
申请退货时才告知食品类一旦签收不能退货，没办法打电话给亚马逊客服，也是一样说法，签收不能退货。	If the customer does not return the product, the customer is not allowed to return the product, and the customer is not allowed to return the product.	yes
我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I had previously bought items in Jingdong and Suning that cannot be returned according to the policy, including milk, diapers, etc., contact customer service has been returned, and Jingdong's diapers have been opened and the taste is too big to contact customer service has been returned, you can not go to Amazon.	yes
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how do you deal with it?	yes
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	Tell me whether I should take it myself, or let the dispatcher buy it himself, since it would not be easy for someone else to do so, why should I ask someone else to pay for something they did not buy themselves?	yes
行，我也不退了，我自己收下了，但是必须给你们的服务打1分	Okay, I'm not going back, I'm taking it myself, but I have to give you one point for your service	yes
劝大家不要白花钱	Don't Pay Money	yes
首先满怀期待购买，觉得都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧，收到了以后看包装觉得还可以，个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感，吃到嘴里完全没有味道，寡淡无味，咬开来果肉一圈是暗黄色就是坏了那种，好坏参着卖的，能吃的也就不到三分之一，劝大家不要买，也不便宜，质量太差了！	In the first place, if you look at the packaging, you can see that it is good, but there is a box that is basically soft and soft, and the appearance is not visible, you have to feel it, eat it in your mouth completely without taste, you have no taste, you bite the pulp a circle is dark yellow or bad, it is good or bad, you can eat less than a third, you are advised not to buy it, it is not cheap, the quality is too bad!	yes
吃一堑长一智，以后再也不在电商买水果了！	Eat a dime, and never again buy fruit from an online store!	yes
产品防伪标识在哪里	What Is The National Debt Limit	yes
瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的，从外包装袋看，感觉蹂躏的程度让人揪心，毕竟是食物类的包装太简单了，而且还是属于国际购的，还有没看到什么明显的防伪标识标志，开瓶非常轻松，关键是盖内的一层蜂蜜直接从里面冒出来了，有开口几乎是没有什么粘连性，外国产品都是这样的吗？	The depression at the bottom of the bottle should have been caused by a strong impact, and the degree of devastation felt in the overpack is heartening, after all, the packaging of the food is too simple, it is international, there is no visible anti-counterfeiting sign, the bottle is easy to open, the key is that a layer of honey in the lid comes out directly from the inside, the opening is almost not sticky, is it the same for foreign products?	yes
生在中国的我有点不理解了。	I was born in China and I don't understand.	yes
应该是正品吧？	Should it be genuine?	yes
还有拍下时提示二十几号到，这个是14号收到的，我第一次在这里海外购，只是把自己的疑惑写下来，或许这都是正常的？	This was the first time I was abroad, and I just wrote down my doubts, maybe it's normal?	yes
提货服务有待改进	Delivery services to be improved	yes
我一共买了5份提货券，在提取时，第一次预约提取3份，结果只寄过来2份，经过多方沟通才确认是漏发、答应后需补发；第二次预约，刚好赶上休息日，网站和微信均无提示需要在工作日预约，造成了不必要的恐慌，建议以后改善。	In the first round, the contestants were given five minutes to choose from, and then three minutes to choose from, and then three minutes to choose from, and then the contestant was asked to choose one of the three options; the contestant was asked to choose one of the three options; the contestant was asked to choose one of the three options, and the contestant was asked to choose one of the three options.	yes
不错的购物	Good shopping	yes
东西好评！	Good Luck!	yes
还是比较相信亚马逊自营的东西，现在海外购以后很方便，从国外买回来物流时间比国内也就多几天，不得不说亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的，比走转运要快很多，所以现在很多东西都在海外购上买。	For example, in the United States, it is more common to buy goods from Amazon than from other countries, and to buy goods from Amazon within a few days, so it is more common to buy goods from Amazon than from other countries.	yes
希望国内商品的质量和价格能够更好一些，很多东西都是国内产的，但是出去转一圈买回来比在国内还便宜，希望改进。	It was hoped that the quality and prices of domestic goods would be better, and that many of them would be domestically produced, but it would be cheaper to go out and buy them back than at home, and it was hoped that improvements would be made.	yes
垃圾	Garbage	yes
看到这样的包裹，试问大家:觉不觉得是路边的垃圾?	When you look at this package, ask: Do you think it's garbage on the roadside?	yes
一个塑料易碎的包装，就用一个塑料袋从所谓的德国发过来，这样的包装是负责的吗?	Is it responsible for a fragile plastic package that comes in a plastic bag from the so-called Germany?	yes
我看这样的包装是装垃圾一样的，购买这个产品，包装及其简陋，没有任何防止破损的措施，就一个简单的塑料袋包装，到手后，包裹完全变形了，里面的物品也有破损。	I see such packaging as rubbish, buy this product, it is in a rudimentary packaging, without any protection against breakage, it is in a simple plastic bag, and when it is in hand, the package is completely deformed and the contents are damaged.	yes
如果我只是碰到一个这样的，我认了，买了几个都是这样子，找亚马逊客服，客服就说可以退，但运费垫付，然后运费以礼品卡的形式返回给我。	If I just come across one of these, I recognize it, I buy several of them like this, I look to Amazon customer service, the customer service says that I can refund, but the shipping fee is advanced, and the shipping fee is returned to me in the form of a gift card.	yes
我试问一下，我用现金支付运费，你们给我返礼品卡，这是要我自己买你们礼品卡就直说啊，还要自己把产品邮寄到德国仓库，这不是买个产品受罪啊!	I ask you, I paid for the shipping in cash, and you gave me back the gift card, and I was asked to buy your gift card myself and say it, and to mail the product to a German warehouse myself, and it was not a crime to buy a product!	yes
而我一直跟客服说，出现这样的问题是谁的责任，客服却半句不说是他们的责任，连半句责任都不敢担当，这样的售后服务还有什么保障呢? 一句话:认栽!但我估计我这个评价，亚马逊都不会给公布的机会，直接回删除!	And I've been saying to the customer service, who is responsible for such a problem, the customer service does not say that it is their responsibility, they do not dare to take even half of the responsibility, what is the guarantee of such after-sales service?	yes

3，物流是硬伤，3号下的单，11号到的。	3, logistics is hard, 3 under the single, 11 to arrive.	yes
4，如果亚马逊没有标注预计到货时间是2月7号，我或许会很满意。	Fourth, I would have been happy if Amazon had not indicated that the expected delivery date was February 7.	yes
5，但标注了预期到货时间，就相当于给用户一个承诺，当承诺无法兑现的时候，用户很难受。	5, but indicating the expected arrival time is equivalent to giving a promise to the user, when the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user is uncomfortable.	yes
6，如果你没有给予承诺的把握，请不要做出承诺。	6. If you do not give the assurance of commitment, please do not make a commitment.	yes
7，实际上，我非常在意商家做出的承诺。	7, in fact, I am very concerned about the promises made by the merchants.	yes
8，所以，我打了低分。	8, so I got a low score.	yes
金线会掉色	the gold thread will fade.	yes
效果还是有的，但感觉是否明显，就看个人咯，或是心理作用。	The effect is still there, but whether the feeling is obvious depends on the individual or the psychological effect.	yes
有一点不太好的，就是金色的线，本来设计出来是觉得好看，但实际上，这个金线会掉色，往车上一放，如果拿动几次，手上，和车上，会有一些金粉。	It is not a good thing that the gold line was designed to look good, but in fact, the gold line will fade and be placed in the car, if you touch it a few times, your hands, and the car, there will be some gold powder.	yes
希望产品可以改进。	Hope the product can be improved.	yes
这种方形的，也没啥装饰效果，就不要搞金线上去，掉下来在车上弄脏车还麻烦。	It is not uncommon for a car to fall off the ground and fall onto the ground, causing damage to the car.	yes
东西完好，速度可以，分2个包裹还不同包装	Things in good condition, speed, 2 parcels in different packages	yes
8天的速度蛮快的，但就是2件分了2个包裹，包装还不一样，明显一个防震太多了，厚纸板贴着，封了层塑料，外包装也方便拆，一个就国内的快递盒似的，放了几个缓冲气囊就算事了，感觉有点敷衍。	For example, in the case of an 8-bit integer, the number of bits in the array is the number of bits in the array, the number of bits in the array is the number of bits in the array, the number of bits in the array, the number of bits in the array, the number of bits in the array, and the number of bits in the array.	yes
雅兰床垫真心不错	Aran mattress is really good	yes
34CM的床垫不是一般的厚，不要床直接睡床垫都可以了。	A 34CM mattress is not usually thick, so it is not necessary to place the bed directly on the mattress.	yes

并不是自营商品，亚马逊无耻了	It's Not Self-Made, the Amazon is shameless	yes
页面明确标注自营，实际上由供应商配送，售后由供应商负责，出问题自行联系供货商。	It is the responsibility of the seller to ensure that the goods are delivered to the buyer, and the seller is responsible for ensuring that the goods are delivered.	yes
想取消订单，对不起，订单信息已传递给供应商，不能取消；想退换货，在亚马逊成功申请了退换货，对不起，没有人理你，需要自行联系供货商退货。	I want to cancel the order, I'm sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, I can not cancel; I want to return, I have successfully applied for a return at Amazon, I'm sorry, there is no one to take care of you, you need to contact the supplier yourself to return.	yes
这尼玛哪门子自营商品。	This is the first time I've seen it.	yes
商品不是亚马逊配送，售后亚马逊不承担，客服竟然说“我帮你联系供应商”，还声称就是自营，太无耻了，赤裸裸的不要脸，赤裸裸的对消费者进行欺诈！	The product is not Amazon, Amazon does not pay, the customer service says "I will help you contact the supplier," and claims that it is self-employed, too shameless, too naked, too naked to cheat on the consumer!	yes
郁闷的体验	A depressing experience	yes
之前在别家网购的滤芯，过滤效果不错，28天结束之后再用多一两天也一样没有水垢。	The filter, which was previously purchased on the Internet, was well filtered and used for another day or two after the end of 28 days without scaling.	yes
由于一直以来在亚马逊购置的东西品质都可以，这次就想着在这边买，第一次在亚马逊买滤芯，感觉不太好，不但早早就开始有水垢，而且滤芯一直用到第28天，都会有悬浮的小黑碳粉，真不知道是继续用下去，还是直接扔了好，非常郁闷~	This is the first time that I have been able to buy a filter in Amazon, and it feels so good, not only has the scale started early, but the filter has been used for 28 days, there will be a little black carbon floating, I do not know if I will continue to use it or throw it directly, it is very depressed.	yes
没有想象的那么好	Not as good as I thought.	yes
和我以往用过的插线板比较，外部做工一般，内部如何未拆开看，但愿如店家所描述，从使用方便性上看，每一独立单位是否通电缺少显示	Compared to the wiring boards I have used in the past, the exterior work is common, and how the interior is not opened, but as described by the shopkeeper, from the point of view of ease of use, whether each independent unit is energized or not	yes
包装破损了，等时间来检验产品的质量。	The packaging was damaged and time was allowed to check the quality of the product.	yes
外包装破损较严重，里面的包装盒似乎是新的，但是说明书好像不是新的，九月才装修，囤货中，希望到时候不会是坏的，请亚马逊解释一下为什么好几个顾客提到包装破损，你们却能安然处之，谢谢！	The outside packaging is damaged, the box inside seems to be new, but the instruction manual seems not to be new, it was renovated in September, it was stocked in the hope that it will not be bad, please Amazon explain why several customers mentioned the package was damaged, but you can rest easy, thank you!	yes
总体不错，有点小问题	Generally good, a little problem	yes
第一次购买滤水壶，看了几篇评价文章，感觉LAICA的性价比高些就选择了这个，收到货按说明书装好了滤芯，试用了一下，感觉总体不错，但是在倒水的时候好像原水会从壶嘴的地方与处理后的水混合（原水仓密封不太严）。	The first time I bought a water filter, I read a few review articles, I felt that the cost of LAICA was higher than this, I received the goods according to the instructions, I loaded the filter, I tried it, I felt good, but when I poured water, it seemed that the raw water would be mixed with the treated water from the spout (the original water tank sealing is not too strict).	yes
用的时候一定要等所有水过滤完再倒出！	When you use it, you must wait for all the water to be filtered before pouring it out!	yes
图片不完整	Picture incomplete	yes
图片没有拍出侧面的细节，侧面的细节跟主体的风格并不一致，有很大差别，这是其一；这个珠子是泰国产的，没有标明产地，这是其二；没有标明质地，这是其三；我在英国买的时候，分明每项各有盒子，这里只有一个简简单单的塑料袋，而且珠子上面没有任何的产品标志，我哪里判断得出是真是假。	There is no detail on the side of the picture, and the detail on the side is very different from the style of the subject, which is one; this bead is from Thailand, which is not indicated, which is the second; the texture is not indicated, which is the third; when I bought it in England, it was clear that each item had a box, there was a simple plastic bag, and there was no product logo on the bead, so I could tell if it was true or false.	yes

6对我来说我只能继续等待...	6 For me I can only continue to wait...	yes
底不平	The Bottom Line	yes
因为看点评里说的都很好，所有对这款锅很有期待，拿到手的时候也很喜欢，很轻巧，但开锅的时候就发现问题了，锅底不是平的，中间突起来，周边凹下去，油都跑到周边了，特意买来的开锅大肥肉炸出好多油都没法覆盖中央区域，糊了，开锅都开不了，这样的构造估计没法正常煮菜。	In this case, it is important to note that all of the ingredients in the recipe are very similar to the original recipe, but it is important to note that the ingredients in the recipe are very similar to the original recipe, and that the ingredients in the recipe are very similar to the ingredients in the recipe, so the ingredients in the recipe are very different.	yes
不知道是否我运气不好，刚好拿到个底子不平的锅，幸亏亚马逊提供一个月的退货服务，果断退了。	I don't know if I was lucky enough to get the bottom of the pot, but I was lucky enough to get a month's return service from Amazon, which I did decisively.	yes

多少次一看到三星这个手机，脑海就想起她，那种痛苦就随之而来灌满全身，我从没舍得用过超过2千元的手机，可是买给她的时候，却毫不犹豫，对一个人再好，可是有天当她变心了，所有的山盟海誓也就烟消云散了。	When I saw this phone, I thought of her in my mind, and that pain filled my whole body, and I never gave up using more than 2,000 dollars, but when I bought it for her, I did not hesitate to be good to a person again, but one day when she changed her mind, all the sworn mountains were gone.	yes

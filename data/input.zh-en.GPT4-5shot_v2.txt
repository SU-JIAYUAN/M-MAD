描述 (DESCRIPTION) C 和 C++ 编译器是集成的.他们都要用四个步骤中的一个或多个处理输入文件: 预处理(preprocessing), Hii(compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking) .	The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.	yes
源文件后级名标识源文件的语言, 但是对编译器来说, 后绥名控制着缺省设定:	The extension of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the extension controls the default settings.	yes
gcc 认为预处理后的文件(.i) 是 c 文件, 并且设定 c 形式的连接，	GCC considers preprocessed files (.i) as C files, and sets up C-style linking.	yes

.h 预处理器文件; 通常不出现在命令行上其他后级名的文件被传递给连接器 (Linker).通常包括:	.h preprocessor files; these usually do not appear on the command line, other files with subsequent names are passed to the linker. This typically includes:	no
.0 目标文件 (Object file)	.0 Object file	no
.a 归档库文件(Archive file)	.a Archive file	no
除非使用了 -cec，-s, 或 -E 选项(或者编译错误阻止了完整的过程),否则连接总是最后的步骤.	Linking is always the final step unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used, or a compilation error prevents the process from completing.	no
在连接阶段中,所有对应于源程序的.e 文件，-1 库文件, 无法识别的文件名(包括指定的.o H 标文件和 .a 库文件)按命令行中的顺序传递给连接器选项 (OPTIONS)	During the linking phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognizable filenames (including specified .o H label files and .a library files) are passed to the linker options (OPTIONS) in the order they appear in the command line.	no
选项必须分立给出 : de ' 完全不同于 `-d -r '.	Options must be given separately: 'de' is entirely different from '-d -r'.	no
大多数 ` -=E :和 `-W' 选项有两个相反的格式 : -fname 和 -fno-name (或 -Wname 和 -Wno- name).	Most `-E' and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).	no
这里只列举不是默认选项的格式.	Only formats that are not the default options are listed here.	no
下面是所有选项的摘要, 按类型分组, 解释放在后面的章节中.	Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in the following sections.	no
代码生成选项 (Code Generation Option)	Code Generation Option	yes
总体选项 (Overall Option)	Overall Option	yes
明确指出后面输入文件的语言为 language (而不是从文件名后绥得到的默认选择).	Explicitly specify the language of the input file as language (rather than the default choice obtained from the file name).	yes
这个选项应用于后面所有的输入文件, 直到遇着下一个 `-x' 选项 .language 的可选	This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next '-x' option is encountered. The language is optional.	yes
关闭任何对语种的明确说明, 因此依据文件名后级处理后面的文件 RE AS E ` -x' 选项).	Close any explicit language specification, therefore process the files behind based on the file name suffix RE AS E `-x' option.	yes
如果只操作四个阶段( 预处理, 编译, 汇编, 连接)中的一部分, 可以使用 ` -x' 选项 (或文件名后 Ah) 告诉 geo 从哪里开始,用 `~-c' ，`-s' ,或 `-E' 选项告诉 geo 到哪里结束.注意,某些选项组合 (例如 ，`-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c 编译或汇编源文件, ETER. ERA ATI 缺省情况下， GCC 通过用 ` .o' 蔡换源文件名后级 ` .ec 标文件名. 可以使用-o 选项选择其他名字.GCC忽略 -ec 选项后面任何无法识别的输入文伯 -S F 何事情.	If only a part of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking) is operated, you can use the `-x' option (or the file name after Ah) to tell geo where to start, and use the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' options to tell geo where to end. Note that some option combinations (for example, `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC replaces the source file name with `.o' and `.ec' file names. You can use the -o option to choose other names. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the -ec option -S F what's going on.	yes
了的目标文件.	The target file.	yes
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	After compilation, it stops and does not proceed to assembly.	yes
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	During the compilation process, pipelines are used instead of temporary files, as the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from pipelines. This is not a problem for GNU's assembler, which can accept a C "dialect" that supports ANSI standard C programs.	yes
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This will close some features in GNU Cc that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, as well as rarely used ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, and despite the use of all standard libraries available in the hosted environment (note: in the hosted environment, the main function returns an int value, a typical example is almost all programs except the kernel. In the corresponding freestanding environment, there is no standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website).	yes
对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', it is handled in the C style - that is, it does not specify the number or type of parameters. (Only for C++).	no
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	Normally, such a function foo in C++ means that the parameters are empty.	no
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	The list of sections was deleted here in an attempt to support certain aspects of traditional C compilers.	no
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	See the NU c manual, we have already deleted the details, so people won't HERI when the content becomes outdated.	no
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the '-traditional' option brings an additional effect, allowing assignment to 'this'.	no
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	The result is the same as with the `-Ethis-is-variable' option.	no
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp attempts to support certain aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.	no
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	Especially the content mentioned above about the preprocessor, but does not include the other effects of the `-traditional' option.	no
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	The -fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the '$' character in identifiers (only for C++).	no
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	You can specify the `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of the `$' symbol.	no
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	(GNU C++ allows the '$' symbol by default on some target systems, but not all.)	no
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	The -fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion from ant type to enumeration type (MEF c++).	no
正常情况下 GNU C++ 允许从 enum 到 int 的转换,反之则不行.	Normally, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around.	no
-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	-fexternal-templates produces smaller code for template declarations (only in C++), by generating a single copy only at the place where each template function is defined.	no
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation' (definition) or `#pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use the template.	no
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', all template instantiations are of external type. You must ensure that the required instances appear in the implementation file.	no
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	This can be achieved through typedef, which references each required instance.	no
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-external-templates' is used during compilation, all template instances are explicitly set as built-in.	no
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All member functions (except for constructors and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class they belong to.	no
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	This does not imply that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.	no
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; when this happens, it is called directly.	no
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch allows the types of the second and third arguments of a conditional expression to not match.	no
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable allows assignment to this (only for c++).	no
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	After integrating the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++, the assignable 'this' seemed out of place.	no
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	Therefore, by default, assigning a value to 'this' within a class member function is an invalid operation.	no
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation valid through the `-fthis-is-variable' option.	no
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	The -funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, similar to unsigned char.	no
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Different machines have their default char type. It could be either unsigned char or signed char.	no
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	Ideally, when dependent on the symbolic nature of data, a portable program should always use either signed char or unsigned char.	no
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	However, many programs have been written to use only simple char, and expect it to be a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine for which the program is written).	no
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This option, and its opposite, make such programs work on the corresponding default values.	no
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	The type of char should always be explicitly defined as either signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.	no
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	If no explicit 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifier is stated, these options are used to define signed bitfields or unsigned bitfields.	no
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	By default, bit fields are signed, as they inherit from basic integer types such as int, which are signed. However, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bit fields are always unsigned.	no
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	-fwritable-strings stores string constants in the writable data segment, without any special treatment.	no
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	This is for compatibility with some old programs that thought modifying string constants was a very bad idea; the `-traditional' option has the same effect.	no

在过去二十年期间，发展中国家吸毒情况的增长速度远远快于发达国家。	Over the past twenty years, the rate of drug use in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.	no
这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。	This reflects to some extent the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.	no
青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。	Teenagers and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.	no
在2000-2018年期间，发展中国家这一年龄段的人口增长了16%,而发达国家这一年龄段的人口减少了10%。	Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while in developed countries it decreased by 10%.	no

无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。	Whether in developed or developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural ones.	no
吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。	Part of the overall increase in drug use is due to the large-scale migration of people from rural to urban areas. Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.	no
城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。	Urbanization could be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where the trend towards urbanization is more pronounced.	no
财富的增加与吸毒情况增多相联，但承受疾病负担最大的是最贫穷的人在世界范围内，发达国家的吸毒情况比发展中国家更为普遍。	Wealth increase is associated with a rise in drug use, but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the poorest people worldwide, with drug use being more common in developed countries than in developing ones.	no
可卡因之类的毒品更是与世界上较富裕的地区联系较为牢固。	Drugs like cocaine are even more strongly associated with wealthier regions of the world.	no

全球新冠肺炎危机造成的经济制约很可能会加剧包括吸毒者在内的最弱势群体的风险。	The global economic constraints caused by the COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.	no
例如，劳动力市场的变化，如失业率上升，过去一直与吸毒情况的增加有关，而这场疫情己经迫使全球数千万人失业。	For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment rates, have historically been associated with an increase in drug use, and this pandemic has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide to become unemployed.	no
新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。	The COVID-19 pandemic could potentially lead to an expansion of the drug market, as more farmers may increase or engage in illegal crop cultivation, either due to reduced control by national authorities or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the face of an economic crisis.	no
新冠肺炎的相关限制措施导致空中和陆路交通减少，海上贩运可能已经因此而增加，海上的拦截风险低，而且比空中或陆路走私的数量更多。	COVID-19 related restrictions have led to a decrease in air and land traffic, potentially increasing maritime trafficking due to its lower interception risk and higher smuggling quantities compared to air or land routes.	no

2新型精神活性物质的使用可能会逐渐牢固存在于弱势群体中	The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly established among vulnerable groups.	no
单一种类的新型精神活性物质几乎从未形成大的市场。	A single new type of psychoactive substance has almost never formed a large market.	no
但来自欧洲的证据表明，合成大麻素在无家可归者和监狱囚犯等社会边缘群体中是一个严重的问题。	However, evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.	no
有22个国家报告了监狱中使用新型精神活性物质的情况，其中大多数国家将合成大麻素确定为主要挑战。	Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.	no
对前体化学品的管制迫使制毒者进行创新最常作为前体用来合成苯丙胺、甲基苯丙胺和“摇头丸”等毒品的许多化学品已被置于国际管制之下。	Regulation of precursor chemicals has forced drug manufacturers to innovate. Many chemicals commonly used as precursors for the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.	no
贩毒者和制毒者一直在寻找替代品一不仅有管制较松的物质，还有专门为规避管制而设计的化学品，即所谓的“特制前体”。	Drug traffickers and manufacturers have been looking for alternatives, not only substances with looser controls, but also chemicals specifically designed to evade regulation, the so-called "designer precursors."	no
旨在阻止新冠肺炎传播的限制性措施很可能使依赖前体化学品的制毒者受到进一步挤压。	Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug manufacturers who rely on precursor chemicals.	no
来自墨西哥的证据表明，这已经成为 现实：据报告，2020年3月，从东亚进口的甲基苯丙胺前体短缺促使墨西哥和美国的甲基苯丙胺价格上涨。	Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: reports indicate that a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia in March 2020 led to a rise in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.	no
市场瞬息万变	The market changes in the blink of an eye.	no
合成药物在中亚和俄罗斯联邦取代阿片剂	Synthetic drugs have replaced opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation.	no

俄罗斯联邦当局截获的阿片剂数量下降了约80%，同时因使用类阿片而接受治疗的人数大幅减少。	The amount of opium intercepted by the Russian Federation authorities has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opiate use has significantly decreased.	no
但兴奋剂市场却似乎日渐兴旺。	However, the stimulant market seems to be growing increasingly vibrant.	no
有证据表明，甲基苯丙胺和各种卡西酮，包括甲氧麻黄酮和 a - 吡咯烷基苯戊酮，现在俄罗斯毒品市场上随处可见。	Evidence suggests that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including methcathinone and alpha-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now ubiquitous in the Russian drug market.	no
俄罗斯当局报告称，最近查获的制造各种非法药物的秘密加工点数量急剧上升，在两年内翻了一番多，2018年增至152个加工点。	Russian authorities reported a sharp increase in the number of secret processing sites for the production of various illegal drugs recently seized, more than doubling in two years, rising to 152 sites in 2018.	no
阿富汗和伊拉克甲基苯丙胺市场增长	Growth in the methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq.	no
早在2012年，对医院、监狱和其他机构人员的调查就已经揭示了甲基苯丙胺在伊拉克的重要性。	As early as 2012, surveys of hospital, prison, and other institutional staff had already revealed the significance of methamphetamine in Iraq.	no
结晶甲基苯丙胺已经成为“芬乃他林”和曲马多之外又一种令人担忧的主要药物。	Crystalline methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to Phentermine and Tramadol.	no
2015年的一项研宄进一步证实了这些发现，吸毒者表示大麻比“芬乃他林”或甲基苯丙胺更难获得。	A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users stating that marijuana was harder to obtain than "fentanyl" or methamphetamine.	no
最近，伊拉克当局发现了多个甲基苯丙胺加工点，麻管局已对伪麻黄碱制剂的大批进口表示关切一甲基苯丙胺加工点将这些制剂用作前体。	Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine processing sites, and the DEA has expressed concern over the large-scale importation of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors at these methamphetamine processing sites.	no
在阿富汗，甲基苯丙胺制造似乎始于2014年。	In Afghanistan, the production of methamphetamine appears to have begun in 2014.	no
自那时起，甲基苯丙胺的缉获量一直在稳步上升。	Since then, the seizure of methamphetamine has been steadily increasing.	no
但2019年上半年的缉获量一^657公斤——与上一年相比大幅骤增。	However, the amount seized in the first half of 2019 was 657 kilograms - a sharp increase compared to the previous year.	no
在其他国家大量缉获了据认为源自阿富汗的甲基苯丙胺，这也表明该国的产量正在迅速上升。	Large amounts of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan have been seized in other countries, indicating that the country's production is rapidly increasing.	no
政策变化和变化趋势	Policy changes and trends.	yes
非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域大多有大麻使用增多的趋势	Jurisdictions where the non-medical use of cannabis has been legalized tend to see an increase in cannabis use.	yes
加拿大、乌拉圭和美国的11个法域允许制造大麻产品供非医疗使用。	Canada, Uruguay, and 11 jurisdictions in the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.	yes
在其中多数法域，大麻使用自合法化以来有所增多，尽管在其他未将非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域也观察到了同样的趋势。	In most jurisdictions where marijuana use has been legalized, there has been an increase in use, although the same trend has been observed in jurisdictions where non-medical use of marijuana has not been legalized.	yes
在美国最早通过立法的两个州科罗拉多州和华盛顿州，成年人非医疗使用大麻的情况增加，特别是过去一个月以及每天或几乎每天使用的情况增多，自2012年起便已超过了全国平均水平。	In the two earliest states to legalize it, Colorado and Washington, adult non-medical use of marijuana has increased, particularly in the past month and daily or nearly daily use, exceeding the national average since 2012.	yes
所有指标都显示，自2011年以来，乌拉圭的大麻使用情况有所增加，上月使用情况几乎翻了一番。	All indicators show that since 2011, the use of marijuana in Uruguay has increased, with last month's usage almost doubling.	yes
这表明增加的主要原因是经常和频繁使用大麻。	This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the frequent and regular use of marijuana.	yes
加拿大的短期数据也表明，2018年至2019年合法市场扩大的同时，使用量也在增加。	Short-term data from Canada also indicates that as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage also increased.	yes
然而，2019年仍有40%的大麻使用者靠非法来源获得某些产品。	However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources.	yes
全球大麻药草缉获量暴跌的背后原因是大麻合法化？	Is the reason behind the global plummet in cannabis seizures the legalization of marijuana?	yes
2018年，全球大麻药草缉获量降至20年来的最低水平，这是因为北美的缉获量下降，在过去10年中下降了 84%。	In 2018, the global seizure of cannabis herb fell to its lowest level in 20 years, due to a decrease in seizures in North America, which had fallen by 84% over the past decade.	no
相比之下，同期世界其他地区的缉获量几乎翻了一番。缉获的模式表明，旨在放开大麻市场的政策在下降中发挥了关键作用。	In contrast, seizures in the rest of the world during the same period almost doubled. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.	no
对新型精神活性物质的监管似乎有遏制作用在国内对新型精神活性物质的监管效果仍然很难评估。	Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect, but the effectiveness of domestic regulation of these substances is still difficult to assess.	no
一些对新型精神活性物质采用不同监管制度的国家显示出不同的新型精神活性物质使用流行率。	Countries with different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of use for these substances.	no
在另一些国家，通过国内立法后，新型精神活性物质使用情况有所减少。	In some other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased following domestic legislation.	no
弱势群体面临合法和非法毒品市场的伤害用于疼痛管理和姑息治疗的药用类阿片主要在高收入国家提供止痛药在各区域分布不均。	Vulnerable groups face harm from both legal and illegal drug markets. Medicinal opioids used for pain management and palliative care are primarily provided in high-income countries, with uneven distribution across regions.	no
2018年，所有可供医疗消费的药用类阿片中，90%以上在高收入国家。	In 2018, over 90% of all medically consumable opiates were in high-income countries.	no
大约50%在北美，40%在欧洲，还有2%在大洋洲。	Approximately 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.	no
这些国家的人口约占全球人口的12%。	The population of these countries accounts for approximately 12% of the global population.	no
据估计，低收入和中等收入国家的人口占全球人口的88%,但消费的药用类阿片却不到10%。	It is estimated that the population of low and middle-income countries makes up 88% of the global population, but consumes less than 10% of medicinal opiates.	no
获取药用类阿片的障碍与许多因素有关，包括立法、文化、卫生系统和处方做法。	The barriers to accessing medicinal opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescription practices.	no
较贫穷的人患吸毒病症的风险更大2018年约有3,560万人患有吸毒病症。	The risk of drug addiction is greater among the poorer population, with approximately 35.6 million people suffering from drug addiction in 2018.	no
贫困、有限的教育和社会边缘化可能会增加吸毒病症风险，并加剧其后果。高收入国家的研宄证实了这一点，在这些研究中，个人不利的社会经济轨迹一不仅仅是他们在某一时间点的状况一也与吸毒病症风险有关。	Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug addiction and exacerbate its consequences. This has been confirmed by studies in high-income countries, where individuals' adverse socio-economic trajectories - not just their status at a particular point in time - are associated with the risk of drug addiction.	no
吸毒病症还会加深社会经济劣势，进一步增加失业、贫困和无家可归的风险，从而助长劣势的恶性循环。这些结果也可能与刑事司法系统内的侮辱性态度和后果有关。	Drug addiction can also exacerbate socio-economic disadvantages, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby fueling a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be associated with stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.	no
妇女、少数民族和移民、性取向多样化群体、因武装冲突或灾难而流离失所的人以及农村环境中的人也可能受到吸毒病症的过重影响，或者在获得治疗服务方面遇到问题。	Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, diverse sexual orientation groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural environments may also be disproportionately affected by drug-related diseases, or encounter problems in accessing treatment services.	no
根据估计因残疾和过早死亡而损失的健康寿命年数的残疾调整寿命年（DALY)指标，在过去10年中，有害的吸毒对范围更广的社会影响加重。	According to the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) index, which estimates the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death, the wider societal impact of harmful drug use has increased over the past decade.	no
2007年至2018年间，归因于吸毒的全球残疾调整寿命年数增加了 17%。	Between 2007 and 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years attributed to drug use increased by 17%.	no
注射吸毒者中常见的未经治疗的丙型肝炎导致的肝癌的相关残疾调整寿命年数增幅特别高——达到40%。	Among injection drug users, the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with untreated hepatitis C leading to liver cancer is particularly high, reaching up to 40%.	no
毒品和暴力之间的关系错综复杂很难确定精神活性物质的使用和暴力之间的所有因果关系。	The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.	no
全球范围的有限数据表明，迷醉可能是杀人的一个重要因素。	Limited global data suggests that intoxication may be a significant factor in homicides.	no
但在暴力事件中，酒精的作用似乎比毒品更大。	But in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a bigger role than drugs.	no
虽然吸毒可能会导致犯罪，但在某些情况下，这种联系可以部分归因于多种中介因素，如社会经济劣势以及由个人风险、家庭环境和同龄人影响造成的其他类型的逆境。	While drug use may lead to criminal behavior, in some cases this link can be partly attributed to various mediating factors such as socio-economic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by individual risk, family environment, and peer influence.	no
贩毒和暴力之间的联系是多方面的。	The connection between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.	no
如果已有稳定的犯罪结构，包括国际贩毒在内的大规模有组织犯罪活动有可能在无暴力的情况下实施。	If there is already a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, could potentially be carried out without violence.	no
短期内，暴力的存在和程度与其说取决于贩运的数量，不如说取决于造成有组织犯罪集团之间力量平衡不稳定的某些变化，例如非法市场规模的变化，知名罪犯的死亡或监禁，以及使一个集团弱于另一个集团的执法措施。	In the short term, the presence and extent of violence depend less on the amount of trafficking and more on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of notorious criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.	no
最新趋势	Latest trends.	yes
吸毒大麻是最常用的物质，类阿片危害最大	Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, while opioids pose the greatest harm.	yes
据估计，2018年使用大麻的有 1.92 亿人，使之成为全球使用最多的毒品。	It is estimated that in 2018, 192 million people used cannabis, making it the most widely used drug in the world.	yes
相比之下，2018年使用类阿片的有5,800万人。	In contrast, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.	yes
但阿片类药物的相关危害却因使用者较少而受到忽视。	However, the associated risks of opioid drugs are often overlooked due to the smaller number of users.	yes
在2017年与吸毒病症有关的估计167,000例死亡中，有66%是这类物质造成的，在据信为吸毒导致的残疾或过早死亡而损失的2,100万年寿命中，有50%是这类物质造成的。	Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and of the 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death believed to be caused by drug use, 50% were caused by these substances.	yes
合成类阿片的非医疗使用加剧了公共卫生危机	The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis.	yes
在西非、中部非洲和北非，加剧类阿片危机的是曲马多；在北美则是芬太尼。这两个区域在经济、人口统计数据或一般吸毒模式方面几乎没有共同点，但都在奋力抗击由容易获得且生产成本低的物质助长的类阿片危机。	In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Tramadol; in North America, it is Fentanyl. These two regions have almost no commonalities in terms of economy, demographic data, or general drug use patterns, but both are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and low-cost substances.	yes
在北美，芬太尼等合成类阿片的使用导致了20年来类阿片过量致死人数增加。	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids like fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.	yes
2018年，在美国登记的67,367例过量死亡中，有三分之二涉及芬太尼。	In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.	yes
加拿大也报告了类似的结果，只是数字较低。	Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.	no
芬太尼导致过量死亡的部分原因是非法药物市场上的芬太尼药效不可预测。	Part of the reason fentanyl causes overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl on the illegal drug market.	no
在西非、中部非洲和北非，非医疗用途曲马多的市场已有大幅增长。	In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, there has been a significant increase in the non-medical use of Tramadol market.	no
在该区域，接受治疗的曲马多使用病症患者越来越多。	In this region, the number of patients using Tramadol for treatment is increasing.	no
2017年，全球截获的曲马多数量显著增加，达到125吨以上的峰值。	In 2017, the global interception of tramadol significantly increased, reaching a peak of over 125 tons.	no
但2018年，在印度通过一项监管曲马多的新法律之后，全球缉获量降至32吨。	But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating turmeric, the global seizure amount dropped to 32 tons.	no
促成这两地危机的是制造简单和生产成本低，此外还有对曲马多和许多芬太尼类似物或其前体缺乏国际监管。	The crises in these two places were brought about by the simplicity of manufacture and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation on carfentanil and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.	no
使这两地危机恶化的是这些物质在药品市场和非法市场上都有供应，因而更加难以发现和防止其滥用。	What exacerbates the crisis in these two places is that these substances are supplied in both the pharmaceutical market and the illegal market, making it even more difficult to detect and prevent their misuse.	no
兴奋剂使用不断增多	The use of stimulants is continually increasing.	no
兴奋剂领域以可卡因和甲基苯丙胺为主，这两种物质在其主要市场的使用量都在上升。	In the field of stimulants, cocaine and methamphetamine are dominant, with the usage of both substances on the rise in their main markets.	no
2018年使用可卡因的约有1,900万人，因为可卡因在北美和西欧颇为流行。	In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as it was quite popular in North America and Western Europe.	no
同年使用苯丙胺的约有2,700万人，其中甲基苯丙胺是东南亚和北美使用最多的苯丙胺类兴奋剂。	In the same year, about 27 million people used amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.	no
根据所掌握的多数指标，20年来这两个区域甲基苯丙胺的使用一直在扩大。	According to most indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding for the past 20 years.	no
在一些市场上，可卡因和甲基苯丙胺可以共存，有时是相互替代，这样一种药物的使用量上升时另一种药物的使用量就下降，有时是同时增加和减少以满足同一市场的需求。	In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, such that when the use of one drug increases, the use of the other decreases, and sometimes both increase and decrease to meet the same market demand.	no
新冠肺炎使注射吸毒者的风险增高	The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk for intravenous drug users.	no
据估计，2018年注射吸毒的约有1,130万人，全球艾滋病毒感染约有10%是注射吸毒造成的。	It is estimated that in 2018, there were about 11.3 million people who injected drugs, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drugs.	no
注射吸毒者感染艾滋病毒的超过100万人，患丙型肝炎的有550万人。	Over one million injection drug users are infected with the HIV virus, and 5.5 million suffer from Hepatitis C.	no
2017年，因吸毒死亡的约有 58.5万人，其中一半死于丙型肝炎引起的肝病，而注射吸毒者的丙型肝炎大多仍未得到治疗。	In 2017, approximately 585,000 people died from drug use, half of which were due to liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most of the hepatitis C in injection drug users remained untreated.	no
5 新冠肺炎限制措施造成的类阿片短缺可能导致使用者代之以酒精或苯二氮类药物等更容易获得的物质，或者将类阿片与合成药物混合。	The restrictions due to COVID-19 may cause a shortage of opioids, leading users to substitute with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.	no
随着一些使用者改用注射或更频繁地注射，可能会出现更多有害的使用方式。	As some users switch to injection or inject more frequently, more harmful methods of use may emerge.	no

欧盟峰会为难民政策争吵不休，欧盟官员：接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈	EU summit argues incessantly over refugee policy, EU official: every step of the reception process has bottlenecks.	yes
【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	According to a report by Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that EU leaders agreed to implement stricter policies on illegal immigration, making it easier to deport illegal immigrants, reported by Niu Ruifei, the special correspondent in Belgium for Global Times.	yes
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	The move by the EU was reportedly a response to the growing concern over illegal immigration in Europe, with the core issue now being that very few illegal immigrants can ultimately be deported.	yes
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	According to summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilise substantial EU funds" to strengthen external borders through infrastructure and surveillance.	yes
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	However, the EU and its member states have been constantly arguing over issues such as the payment of fence costs.	yes
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	Von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not cover the related costs.	yes
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	However, diplomats from some member countries said that if Europe could share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external borders, it would free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.	yes
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	The European website Euractiv reported that EU officials admitted that there were bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, and the limited reception capacity and overburdened immigration authorities of member states could not prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in EU countries, leaving the EU's refugee reception system in a near "permanent crisis".	yes
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	According to estimates by the European Commission, Schengen countries in the EU received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half more than the previous year.	yes
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	Meanwhile, the EU recorded over 330,000 instances of illegal entry last year.	no
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	In this context, the summit also reached an agreement on a "principle" that EU countries can deport illegal immigrants based on the court decision of another member state.	no
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	Additionally, it was reported that EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of safe countries," paving the way for the EU to compile a common list.	no

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	The US escalates "chip war" severely damaging the global semiconductor industry - China News Network.	yes
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	Recently, the US "chip war" against China has shown signs of escalating - first, under US pressure, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; then foreign media reported that the US government is considering severing all ties between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order restricting US investment in China's sensitive technology industries... Shortly after the start of 2023, the US has been relentless in its efforts to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.	yes
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	In recent years, the United States has never ceased its efforts to curb China's development in the "core" sector, precisely suppressing the semiconductor supply chain to China on one hand, and constructing a "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain alliance on the other, aiming to completely "shake off" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.	yes
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it's courting South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or establishing a chip "quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, or establishing a semiconductor industry "small circle" through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia "quadrilateral mechanism" and "Indo-Pacific economic framework", the United States is attempting to build a closed supply chain cycle dominated by the US by introducing politicized, camp-based, and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry, in order to make up for its shortcomings in chip manufacturing and maintain its advantageous position in the global chip industry.	yes
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	However, the US's high-profile "chip tactics" against China also resulted in a "lose-lose" situation.	yes
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	Recently, the well-known American chip manufacturing equipment supplier, Lam Research Group, announced that due to the impact of the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plans to lay off another 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.	yes
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	The global lithography giant, ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands, recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to an increase in semiconductor prices.	yes
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	US media analysis shows that after the US government's aggressive suppression of China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies have been severely affected, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves.	yes
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	The so-called US suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.	yes
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain has already been formed.	yes
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	According to professionals, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross national borders more than 70 times, taking up to 100 days in total.	no
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Despite a strong foundation in the semiconductor industry, the United States is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially in advanced process technology, and heavily relies on the East Asia region.	no
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	Even though the United States is making great efforts to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain towards a regional development dominated by a "small circle" of the US, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries are hard to change.	no
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The United States' aggressive "reshaping" and "de-Sinicization" of the semiconductor industry chain has severely impacted the global semiconductor industry.	no
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	The chip is at the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the participation of countries around the world.	no
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introducing the "Innovation and Competition Act", the "2022 American Competitiveness Act", and the "Chips and Science Act", using technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership; it has both rewarded and threatened allies, enticing chip manufacturers such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to set up factories in the US, striving to ensure America's global leadership in the chip field.	no
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	In the short term, the United States has indeed caused trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, reaping real benefits.	no
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	But in the long run, the hysterical suppression by the United States has forced the Chinese chip industry to continuously break through, causing it to lose a huge Chinese market, which will ultimately greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of American technology companies, and harm the development of the global chip industry.	no

首批个人养老金理财产品发售，标志着个人养老金投资者可正式通过个人养老金资金账户购买理财产品。	The launch of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marked that personal pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.	no
去年11月银保监会制定了《商业银行和理财公司个人养老金业务管理暂行办法 》 。	In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies".	no
《办法》规定，参加人可以通过个人养老金资金账户购买个人养老储蓄、个人养老金理财产品、个人养老金保险产品、个人养老金公募基金产品等个人养老金产品。	The regulations stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public fund products, and other personal pension products through their personal pension fund accounts.	no
随后，人社部、财政部、国家税务总局三部门发布通知，明确个人养老金制度在北京、天津，以及河北石家庄、雄安新区，山西晋城市等36个先行城市和地区启动实施。	Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Taxation Administration issued a notice, clearly stating that the individual pension system would be implemented in Beijing, Tianjin, as well as 36 pilot cities and regions including Shijiazhuang in Hebei, Xiong'an New Area, and Jincheng City in Shanxi.	no

专业人士指出，投资者要根据产品特点和自己的风险承受能力进行选择。	Professionals point out that investors should make choices based on the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.	no

健身行业应摆脱信任危机-中新网	The fitness industry should overcome the trust crisis - China News Network.	yes
又一大型健身房“暴雷”？	Another major gym "going bust"?	yes
近日，知名健身机构中健健身会员维权问题引起社会关注。	Recently, the issue of member rights protection at the well-known fitness organization, Zhongjian Fitness, has attracted social attention.	yes
春节后不少会员发现自己所在门店没有正常营业，随后，关于该机构倒闭跑路的传闻引起会员恐慌，导致公安、人社部门介入。	After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the institution's bankruptcy and absconding caused panic among the members, leading to the intervention of the public security and human resources departments.	yes
最后，该机构相关负责人出面回应，承诺会努力保障好员工和会员的合法权益，风波才得以平息。	Finally, the person in charge of the agency responded, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the controversy was settled.	yes
个别健身机构的部分门店出现经营问题，暂时关闭，消费者本可心平气和等待问题解决，为何不少会员的第一反应是“大事不妙”？	Why is it that when individual fitness institutions temporarily close some of their branches due to operational issues, instead of calmly waiting for the problem to be resolved, many members' first reaction is "something is seriously wrong"?	yes
健身俱乐部会员维权风波背后，是行业信任危机的深层次问题。	Behind the controversy over gym club membership rights, there is a deeper issue of trust crisis in the industry.	yes
国内传统健身房普遍采取预付费模式，“赚用户不来的钱”是其发展的底层逻辑。	Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and "earning money from non-attending users" is the underlying logic of their development.	yes
通过预售会员卡获取现金流，不断开新店，看似能够循环往复，实则寅吃卯粮，无法形成稳定的盈利模式。	By obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and continuously opening new stores, it seems like a cycle that can be repeated. However, it's actually robbing Peter to pay Paul, and cannot form a stable profit model.	yes
健身房跑路等行业负面信息频频传出，对消费者信心造成强烈冲击。	Negative news such as gym closures are frequently reported in the industry, causing a strong impact on consumer confidence.	yes
从市场前景看，健身房当然算得上是一门有“钱途”的好生意。	From a market perspective, a gym can certainly be considered a good business with a "money-making" future.	no
健身赛道虽然起起伏伏，但始终受到资本关注。	Despite its ups and downs, the fitness track has always attracted capital attention.	no
多项数据显示，文体消费等领域热度不断攀升，市场持续回暖。	Multiple data show that the popularity in areas such as cultural and sports consumption continues to rise, indicating a sustained market recovery.	no
具体到健身市场，随着居民生活水平稳步提高，健康生活理念深入人心，健身行业发展大有可为。	Specifically in the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the deepening of the concept of healthy living, there is great potential for the development of the fitness industry.	no
形势越是趋好，行业越需重视发展质量。	The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.	no
然而，个别机构对消费复苏后的健身市场盲目乐观，刚从危机中走出来，又吹响开疆拓土的号角，把融资资金一股脑投入新店建设上。	However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumer recovery, just emerging from the crisis, they are blowing the horn of pioneering and expanding, pouring all their financing funds into the construction of new stores.	no
不可否认，这几年受疫情影响，不少机构退出，行业重新洗牌，有实力的企业此时选择性地加大收购力度、重新布局，未尝不是新机遇。	Undeniably, in recent years, due to the impact of the pandemic, many institutions have withdrawn, and the industry has reshuffled. Strong companies are selectively increasing their acquisition efforts and repositioning, which may present new opportunities.	no
但是，健身市场发展要想进入良性循环，迈上行稳致远的康庄大道，行业就必须改变传统模式，改变经营策略。	However, if the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous cycle and embark on a steady and long-term path, the industry must change its traditional model and business strategy.	no
只有稳扎稳打，重新建立起消费者的信任度、安全感，才能真正赢得市场、赢得未来。	Only by being steady and reliable, and re-establishing consumer trust and security, can we truly win the market and the future.	no
相比大建新店抢占市场，健身行业当前更需要的是沉下心来优化服务，用高质量发展来稳住用户。	Compared to aggressively expanding with new stores, what the fitness industry currently needs more is to focus on improving services and retaining customers through high-quality development.	no
首先，要靠服务留住用户。	Firstly, retaining users relies on providing good service.	no
健身房属于服务行业，其本质是坚持“用户导向”，要紧紧围绕用户需求，把经营重心放在服务提质升级上。	Gyms belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to a "user-oriented" approach, focusing closely on user needs and placing the emphasis on improving and upgrading services.	no
其次，要靠数字化转型提升用户体验。	Secondly, digital transformation is needed to enhance the user experience.	no
比如当下流行的互联网健身房模式，实现用户按次付费和场地自选。	For example, the currently popular internet gym model allows users to pay per use and choose their own location.	no
同时，身体数据、运动数据得以有效利用，还可以满足社交需求，实现从线上到线下完整的服务闭环。	At the same time, physical data and exercise data can be effectively utilized, and social needs can be met, achieving a complete service loop from online to offline.	no
没有私教推销，没有巨额年卡，用户对健身机构“跑路”的担忧降低了，信任感也就提升了。	Without personal trainer sales pitches and expensive annual memberships, users' concerns about fitness institutions "running away" are reduced, thus increasing trust.	no

买贵退差价！	Buy at a higher price, get a refund for the difference!	yes
南京楼市再现“差价赔付”-中新网	"Nanjing's real estate market sees a resurgence of 'price difference compensation' - China News Network"	yes
扬子晚报讯(记者 马祚波)扬子晚报/紫牛新闻记者10日在采访中发现，十余年未见的“保价协议”又重回了南京楼市，位于江北新区的一家楼盘宣称“差价赔付”，在交房前其他房源的优惠大于之前的折扣，开发商愿意为买房人换房并退还差价。	Yangzi Evening News reported (by reporter Ma Zuobo) that Yangzi Evening News/Zi Niu News reporters discovered in an interview on the 10th that the "price protection agreement", which had not been seen for more than ten years, has returned to the Nanjing property market. A property development in the Jiangbei New District claimed "price difference compensation". If the discounts on other properties before the handover are greater than the previous discounts, the developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.	yes
“保价协议”条件可不少	The conditions of the "insurance agreement" can be numerous.	yes
这家位于江北新区的楼盘名为保利扬子萃云台，看房人孙先生告诉记者，他在上周末逛楼盘时发现了一则“声明”。	The property located in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai. A prospective buyer, Mr. Sun, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he visited the property last weekend.	yes
他发给记者的图片上显示，该楼盘的开发商承诺，凡是在2月1日-2月28日期间购买房源的，自双方签订买卖合同之日起至对应房源交付，若该项目其他房源的优惠折扣大于之前购房所享折扣的(限与该商品房属于同一户型、同一楼栋、同一单元、同一物业类型的其他未售商品房)，开发商可以为购房者换房并退还差价。	The picture he sent to reporters showed that the developer of the property promised that anyone who purchased a property between February 1 and February 28 would, from the date of signing the sales contract to the delivery of the corresponding property, if the discount on other properties in the project was greater than the discount previously enjoyed (limited to other unsold properties of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type), the developer could change the property for the buyer and refund the difference.	yes
孙先生表示，置业顾问表示这其实就是一份“保价协议”，目的是让买家放心出手，不用担心开发企业降价促销，“现在就怕买完了它就降价了，去售楼处闹吧没时间，不闹的话也确实窝心”。	Mr. Sun stated that the property consultant said this was actually a "price protection agreement," designed to reassure buyers and prevent them from worrying about the developer lowering prices for promotions. "The fear now is that the price will drop after purchase. There's no time to make a fuss at the sales office, and it's indeed frustrating if you don't complain," he said.	yes
还有不少买房人则认为，“保价协议”虽然是在给购房者吃“定心丸”，不过条件却不低。	Many homebuyers believe that while "price protection agreements" are meant to reassure purchasers, the conditions are not low.	yes
打算在江北买一套刚需房的郑女士说，保价的房源首先是要同一户型，还得在同一楼栋、同一个单元，买家可以比价的房源寥寥，因此“门槛”还是蛮高的。	Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a house in Jiangbei, said that the houses with a guaranteed price must first be of the same type, and also in the same building and unit. There are very few houses for buyers to compare prices, so the "threshold" is still quite high.	yes
也有购房者认为，由于信息不对称，销售时不排除给出额外的让利，买家“维权”的难度不小。	Some homebuyers believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not ruled out that extra concessions may be given during sales, and it is not easy for buyers to "defend their rights".	yes
能否留住买房人有待观察	Whether homebuyers can be retained remains to be seen.	no
记者在南京网上房地产上查询得知，该楼盘于去年11月首领两幢楼共计252套房源的销许，户型面积有105平方米、114平方米、129平方米等，全装修销许均价为39843元/㎡。	A reporter found out from Nanjing's online real estate that the property launched a total of 252 units in two buildings last November, with apartment sizes of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, and 129 square meters, etc. The average selling price for fully furnished units was 39,843 yuan per square meter.	no
不过两个多月过去，网上房地产显示目前该楼盘的未售总套数为157套，占比为62.3%，其中8号楼共计128套，未售套数达113套，7号楼的124套中也有44套未售，项目的总成交套数只有33套，占比仅为13%。	However, more than two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in this property is 157, accounting for 62.3% of the total. Among them, there are 128 units in Building 8, with 113 unsold units. Out of 124 units in Building 7, 44 are unsold. The total number of transactions for the project is only 33 units, accounting for just 13%.	no
市场人士介绍，“保价协议”在2008年也曾在南京出现过。	Market insiders explained that the "price protection agreement" had also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.	no
当年8月份，河西黄山路上的楼盘横塘西苑为了吸引买房人眼球，推出了《保价计划》，具体内容为“公司郑重承诺，若一年内项目优惠幅度扩大，由此产生的差额，公司将按差额退还给老业主”。	In August of that year, to attract buyers, the real estate development on Huangshan Road in Hexi, Hengtang West Garden, launched a "Price Guarantee Plan". The specific content was "The company solemnly promises that if the discount range of the project expands within a year, the company will return the difference to the old owners."	no
此后2011年4月，南京也有9家楼盘拿出部分房源承诺“差价赔付”。	In April 2011, nine real estate developments in Nanjing also offered a portion of their properties with a "price difference compensation" promise.	no
“楼市在回暖，此时更需要一针‘强心剂’。	"The real estate market is recovering, and it needs a 'cardiotonic' more than ever at this moment."	no
”南京地产行业一位资深操盘手沈先生表示，“保价协议”也是房企的营销方式之一。	"Price protection agreements are also one of the marketing strategies of real estate companies," said Mr. Shen, a veteran operator in the Nanjing real estate industry.	no
他认为如今开发企业比买房人更需要信心，推出“保价协议”其实也是在给其打气。	He believes that nowadays, property developers need confidence more than homebuyers, and the introduction of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually a morale booster for them.	no
至于能否留住买房人，他表示这取决于调控政策、贷款门槛等多重因素的影响，就目前来看仍有待观察。	As for whether homebuyers can be retained, he said it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, which still need to be observed for now.	no
多项数据衰退 台湾经济开年表现不佳-中新网	Multiple data declines, Taiwan's economy starts the year poorly - China News Network.	yes
新华社台北2月11日电(记者赵博、黄扬)出口贸易额“连五黑”，制造业采购经理人指数(PMI)连续7个月紧缩，消费者物价指数(CPI)又见“3字头”……近期，台湾当局陆续发布2023年1月经济数据。	Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11th (Reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) - With export trade volume experiencing five consecutive months of decline, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) shrinking for seven consecutive months, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) once again hitting the "3-digit" mark... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.	yes

该部门统计处长蔡美娜表示，这显示消费性电子产业需求疲弱效应扩散，电子产业进入修正期。	The head of the department's statistics bureau, Cai Meina, stated that this shows a diffusion of weak demand in the consumer electronics industry, indicating that the electronics industry has entered a correction period.	yes
统计显示，1月台湾地区进出口双降，出超金额仅23.4亿美元，创近3年来最低水平。	Statistics show that in January, both imports and exports in Taiwan decreased, with a trade surplus of only 2.34 billion US dollars, the lowest level in nearly three years.	yes
台当局财政事务主管部门认为，全球终端需求减少，产业调整库存抑制厂商购料意愿，出口颓势短期难见改善，台湾今年首季出口衰退恐高于预期。	The financial authority in Taiwan believes that due to the global decrease in terminal demand and industry inventory adjustments suppressing manufacturers' willingness to purchase materials, the decline in exports is unlikely to improve in the short term. The decline in Taiwan's exports in the first quarter of this year may be worse than expected.	no
据台湾中华经济研究院发布，今年1月台湾制造业采购经理人指数(PMI)经季节调整后为40.4%，较去年12月续跌3.3个百分点，连续7个月紧缩。	According to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, the seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for Taiwan's manufacturing sector was 40.4% in January of this year, a continuous contraction for seven months, and a decrease of 3.3 percentage points from December of the previous year.	no
经济监测指标体系中，PMI以50%为荣枯线，指数大于50%，代表景气扩张，反之为紧缩。	In the economic monitoring indicator system, PMI uses 50% as the boom-bust line. An index greater than 50% represents economic expansion, while less than 50% indicates contraction.	no
1月台湾PMI五项组成指标中，新增订单、生产与人力雇佣紧缩，供应商交货时间下降，存货紧缩。	In January, among the five components of Taiwan's PMI, new orders, production and employment contracted, supplier delivery times fell, and inventory tightened.	no
六大产业全数回报PMI紧缩，各产业依紧缩速度排序为电力暨机械设备产业(35.1%)、电子暨光学产业(35.2%)、化学暨生技医疗产业(39.2%)、基础原物料产业(42.4%)、交通工具产业(42.6%)与食品暨纺织产业(45.7%)。	All six industries reported a contraction in PMI, with the industries ranked by contraction speed as follows: power and machinery equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optics industry (35.2%), chemical and biotech medical industry (39.2%), basic raw materials industry (42.4%), transportation equipment industry (42.6%), and food and textile industry (45.7%).	no
物价方面，台当局“主计总处”公布，今年1月台湾CPI年增率为3.04%，自去年7月以来再度冲破3%。	In terms of prices, the Taiwan authorities' "Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics" announced that the annual increase rate of Taiwan's CPI in January this year was 3.04%, breaking 3% again since last July.	no
其中，蔬菜价格飞涨28.25%，创17个月新高。	Among them, vegetable prices soared by 28.25%, hitting a 17-month high.	no
台“主计总处”专门委员曹志弘坦言，菜价涨幅确实超乎预期，排除春节因素，今年1月和2月平均CPI应接近去年12月的2.71%，通胀压力还是存在，且仍在高点。	Cao Zhihong, a special commissioner of the Taiwan "Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics," admitted that the increase in vegetable prices was indeed beyond expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year, indicating that inflationary pressure still exists and remains high.	no
展望今年台湾经济，综合《联合报》、“Yahoo财经”等岛内媒体报道，专家表示悲观。	Looking ahead to Taiwan's economy this year, experts expressed pessimism, according to reports from local media such as the United Daily News and Yahoo Finance.	no
台“中央大学”经济系教授吴大任分析，出口衰退可能造成出口制造业厂商现金流出现问题，债务违约风险上升。	Professor Wu Dare from the Department of Economics at Central University in Taiwan analyzed that a decline in exports could cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing firms, increasing the risk of debt default.	no
同时，订单减少导致厂商削减人力成本，影响劳动市场和家庭经济，反过来冲击消费能力。	At the same time, a decrease in orders led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn impacted consumer spending power.	no
台湾经济研究院研究员邱达生认为，今年欧美通胀状况未解，需求持续萎缩，预估台湾出口衰退会延续到上半年。	Taiwan Economic Research Institute researcher Qiu Dasheng believes that this year's inflation situation in Europe and America has not been resolved, demand continues to shrink, and it is predicted that Taiwan's export recession will continue into the first half of the year.	no
由于台湾经济靠出口支撑，受出口低迷影响，全年经济增长表现将不如去年。	As Taiwan's economy is export-driven, the economic growth for the year will not be as good as last year due to the downturn in exports.	no

“无内容，不电商”，随着短视频和直播电商不断发展，人们对电商内容的要求和标准正步入新阶段。	"With no content, there is no e-commerce." As short video and live-streaming e-commerce continue to develop, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.	no

报告认为，电商行业内容生态是一个综合性概念，是将电商与内容进行整合，但并非所有内容都可与电商整合，好的PGC(专业生产内容)与UGC(用户原创内容)才是与电商进行整合的优质载体，内容平台价值越高，消费与推广的场景也就越来越丰富，电商植入的可能性也就越高，商业价值也就越强，这种公共领域和私人领域逐步集成分布的电商内容生产和内容消费的比例也就会越高。	The report suggests that the content ecosystem in the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce with content. However, not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (Professionally Generated Content) and UGC (User Generated Content) are the high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce.

他表示，就内容价值而言，当前电商行业已经从“消费可及性”过渡到“消费品质化”阶段，优质、专业、差异化的内容是电商行业的“硬通货”。	He stated that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from the "consumer accessibility" stage to the "consumer quality" stage, and high-quality, professional, differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.	no
同时，内容成为电商发展新阶段的根本和抓手，知识付费、专业性知识、KOL(关键意见领袖)等PGC内容开始在电商直播中成为标配。	At the same time, content has become the foundation and focus of the new stage of e-commerce development, with paid knowledge, professional knowledge, and KOL (Key Opinion Leaders) and other PGC content starting to become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.	no
展望电商行业的未来发展，喻国明提出两方面的建议。	Looking towards the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming proposed two suggestions.	no
一个是从内容结构提升的角度看，推动电商内容生态健康程度和质量整体提升，打造正向内容创作和管理标准，实现电商行业内容生态健康系统指数与动态均衡。	One perspective is to promote the overall improvement of the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecosystem from the perspective of content structure enhancement, to create positive content creation and management standards, and to achieve a dynamic balance of the health system index of the e-commerce industry content ecosystem.	no
另一个是从外部生态看，要实现内容电商行业的健康发展和外部环境的价值协同与共创。	Another perspective is from the external ecology, to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.	no

The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong Un is pushing his teenage daughter into the position of successor," but there are also views that such a judgment is still premature, and in the situation where Kim Jong Un has a son, all possibilities are still preserved.	no
重阳问答︱如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Chongyang Q&A: How to view the US non-farm employment data in January greatly exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.	yes
Q：请问重阳投资，如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势？	Q: How does Chongyang Investment view the significantly better-than-expected non-farm employment data in the US in January and its future trend?	yes
A：2月3日美国劳工部公布2023年1月非农就业数据，新增非农就业51.7万人，大幅高于市场预期的18.9万人；失业率降至3.4%，为近50年以来的最低位；时薪同比增速4.4%，环比增速0.3%，略有放缓。	On February 3rd, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the non-farm employment data for January 2023, with an increase of 517,000 non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; the year-on-year wage growth was 4.4%, and the month-on-month growth was 0.3%, slightly slowing down.	yes
从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	In terms of the total amount, this data is subject to many one-time and technical factors, such as returning striking teachers, revisions to the survey statistical caliber, updates to the seasonal adjustment factor, and may be revised in the future (refer to the January 2022 non-farm payroll revision from 504,000 to 364,000). Non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data suggests.	yes
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	Structurally, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still present, but the proportion is relatively low; high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare have seen a significant rebound in new employment, and data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.	yes
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Given the equally larger-than-expected rise in service sector PMI, job vacancies, labor shortage data, and strong consumer credit data, we judge that the US service sector has experienced a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.	yes
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	We believe that it is difficult to improve the tension between supply and demand in the US job market without going through a recession.	yes
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	Currently, there is still a supply gap of over 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 year olds, which is close to the pre-pandemic peak.	yes
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	In addition, due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit among US residents, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of austerity policies on the job market.	yes
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	The continued tension in the US job market supply and demand will be the underlying tone of the US economy in 2023.	yes
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	With the current overlay nearing the end of rate hikes and inflation expectations constantly fluctuating, we are not optimistic about the continuous decline in wage growth.	no
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Before the data was released, the US stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike path.	no
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Federal Reserve has been maintaining a delicate balance of fragile market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of interest rate hikes. However, the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish rhetoric, not only expecting an early halt to rate hikes, but also expecting two rate cuts by the end of the year.	no
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	In a labor market with tight supply and demand, and unclear effects of tightening policies, we believe that the Federal Reserve's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. The adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded trading may cause some damage to the market.	no
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the year-on-year M2 data turning negative and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-item leading indicators, the US CPI data has entered a rapid decline stage since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only form a bottom for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of game after the next inflation data is released.	no
杉杉创始人郑永刚因突发心脏疾病过世 曾带领中国服装第一股转型 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	The founder of Shanshan, Zheng Yonggang, passed away due to a sudden heart disease. He once led the transformation of China's first clothing stock - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.	yes
经济观察网 记者 郑淯心 2月11日，认证主体为杉杉控股有限公司（以下简称“杉杉控股 ” ） 的微信公众号发布讣告，杉杉企业创始人、杉杉控股董事局主席郑永刚因突发心脏疾病救治无效，于2023年2月10日去世，享年65岁。	On February 11, a WeChat public account certified by Shanshan Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") announced the death of Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings. Zheng passed away on February 10, 2023, due to a sudden heart disease, at the age of 65, reported by Zheng Yuxin, a journalist from Economic Observer.	yes
上世纪80年代，郑永刚担任国营棉纺厂的厂长，随着调任，1989年郑永刚成为杉杉股份的前身宁波云港服装总厂的厂长。	In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of a state-owned cotton spinning factory, and with his transfer, he became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Shares, in 1989.	yes
2022年12月，在第二十届中国企业领袖年会暨第二十二届中国企业未来之星年会上，郑永刚在演讲中称，在上世纪90年代的中国西服市场，杉杉品牌的市占率曾高达37 % 。	In December 2022, at the 20th China Business Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Future Stars Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang stated in his speech that in the Chinese suit market of the 1990s, the market share of the Shanshan brand once reached as high as 37%.	yes
1996年杉杉股份（600884.SH）上市，成为中国服装业第一家上市公司。	In 1996, Shanshan Shares (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's clothing industry.	yes
就在服装业务如日中天时，杉杉集团却开始转型，因为郑永刚意识到 ， “ 一旦市场放开，中国品牌自然会形成一个梯队式品牌市场，杉杉西服想一直独领风骚，长期成为国人的国服的可能性不大 ” 。	Just as the clothing business was booming, the Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened up, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and the possibility of Shanshan suits always leading the trend and becoming the national dress of the Chinese people in the long term is not great."	yes
1999年，杉杉开始研究企业转型，郑永刚回忆当年 ， “ 我们来到上海，寻求到底转型做什么，专门找了很多专家学者，连续不断地开一些诸葛亮会、务虚研讨会。	In 1999, Shanshan began researching corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled, "We came to Shanghai to figure out what to do with the transformation. We specifically sought out many experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings and theoretical seminars."	yes
最后，我们设定了两个大的战略方向。	Finally, we have set two major strategic directions.	yes
第一个方向是新能源新材料，另外一个是大健康有未来 ” 。	The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is "great health has a future".	yes
战略方向确定后，杉杉开始寻找合作，那时候鞍山热能院为鞍钢配套的炭素研究所在做国家863课题，科研经费不够，于是杉杉和鞍山热能院碳素研究所签署合作协议，共同推动国家863课题“中间相炭微球”项目产业化，从事负极材料的研发、生产和销售，在国内实现负极材料的商用推广。	After determining the strategic direction, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, Anshan Thermal Energy Institute, a carbon research institute supporting Ansteel, was conducting a national 863 project with insufficient research funding. Therefore, Shanshan signed a cooperation agreement with Anshan Thermal Energy Institute Carbon Research Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Intermediate Phase Carbon Microsphere" project, engage in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and promote the commercial use of negative electrode materials domestically.	yes
2001年，杉杉股份实现中间相炭微球的规模化生产，开始国产化替代，取代日本成为国内中间相炭微球主要供应商。	In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. achieved large-scale production of mesophase pitch microspheres, began domestic substitution, and replaced Japan as the main supplier of mesophase pitch microspheres in China.	no
这是中国第一家锂离子电池负极材料生产企业，实现了锂离子电池负极材料国产化。	This is the first Chinese company to produce anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, achieving the domestic production of these materials.	no
随着锂电池的应用迅速普及，杉杉股份的锂电池业务开始逐步发展，2007年锂电材料业务被写入了杉杉股份的主营业务，服装业务营收占比逐年减少，直至2013年，杉杉股份的锂电材料业务收入全面超过服装业务。	With the rapid popularization of lithium batteries, Sunsun Shares' lithium battery business began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into Sunsun Shares' main business, and the proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year, until 2013, when the revenue from Sunsun Shares' lithium battery material business fully surpassed the clothing business.	no
2021年2月，杉杉股份成功并购LG化学偏光片业务，进军LCD偏光片市场，并成立偏光片企业杉金光电，该领域技术含量比较高，杉杉的主要的竞争对手都是世界500强，如韩国三星、日本的住友化学、日东电工。	In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer company Shangjin Optoelectronics. The technology in this field is relatively advanced, and Shanshan's main competitors are Fortune 500 companies such as Samsung from South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical from Japan, and Nitto Denko.	no
郑永刚曾分享过投后管理的心得 ， “ 中国的民营企业收购国际上的一些高科技企业，成功概率比较低，为什么那些收购会失败？	Zheng Yonggang once shared his insights on post-investment management, "Why do acquisitions of some high-tech companies internationally by China's private enterprises have a relatively low success rate? Why do those acquisitions fail?	no
因为大家都会去考虑，我花了那么多钱，我得去派人管对吧，这是通常会做的一个行为 ” ， 然而郑永刚则不同，杉杉收购成功的那一天，郑永刚就到杉金光电当众宣布，杉杉作为杉金的大股东，决定实施一企两制，除了郑永刚担任董事长，杉杉企业的人不派到杉金，采取授权经营的方式，原有的分配制度、企业文化、各项管理等模式不变。	"Everyone would consider, 'I've spent so much money, I need to send someone to manage it, right?' This is a common behavior," however, Zheng Yonggang was different. On the day of the successful acquisition of Shanshan, Zheng Yonggang publicly announced at Shanjing Optoelectronics that Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shanjing, decided to implement a 'one enterprise, two systems' policy. Apart from Zheng Yonggang serving as the chairman, no one from Shanshan Enterprises would be sent to Shanjing. They would adopt an authorized management approach, and the original distribution system, corporate culture, and various management models would remain unchanged.	no

夏立言与宋涛会面谈到国共的政治基础是“九二共识”与反台独，国民党国政基金会资深顾问赵春山则在会中表示，国民党的“九二共识”是原汁原味的“九二共识”。	During his meeting with Song Tao, Xia Liyan discussed that the political foundation of the KMT and the CCP is the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the KMT's National Policy Foundation, stated in the meeting that the KMT's "1992 Consensus" is the original "1992 Consensus".	yes
赵春山分析，这与前几次参与的会议感受不同。	Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this was different from the previous meetings he had attended.	yes

赵春山指出，两岸兵凶战危，中国大陆盼能透过国民党转达改善关系的意向。	Zhao Chunshan pointed out that in the face of military tensions across the strait, mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.	no
因为民共之间没有互信，对方仍愿做好对台湾人工作，代表不希望两岸关系搞坏。	Because there is no mutual trust between the people and the communists, the other side is still willing to do a good job for the people of Taiwan, indicating that they do not want cross-strait relations to deteriorate.	no
据赵春山也说，王沪宁也亲自下指示向宋涛讲“他们（台湾农渔民）提的要求，你们一定要落实”，若无法通盘解决，也要采个案处理。	According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning personally instructed Song Tao, saying "You must implement the demands raised by them (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen).

鉴于对于大部分法国人来说，周六是公休日，他们不需要在是参加示威抗议活动，还是扣工资罢工之间做出选择，工会团体因此希望今天的集会活动能吸引更多人参与。	Given that for most French people, Saturday is a day off, they do not need to choose between participating in protest demonstrations or losing wages due to a strike. Therefore, union groups hope that today's rally can attract more participants.	yes
公交系统地铁以及公营铁路公司的工会今天均未呼吁员工罢工，公交系统应该能正常运作，市民可以乘车前往集会地点，同时，在学校开始放冬假的地区，人们可以正常启程度假。	The unions of the bus system, subway, and public railway companies did not call for a strike today, so the bus system should operate normally. Citizens can take the bus to the rally site, and in areas where schools have started winter vacation, people can start their holidays as usual.	yes

自这次反政府退休金改革方案抗议行动开始以来，虽然民调显示，多数法国人不支持将法定退休年龄从目前的62岁推迟到64岁的措施，但真正走上街头参与游行的人数逐渐减少。	Since the start of the anti-government pension reform protests, although polls show that the majority of French people do not support the measure to delay the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets to participate in marches has gradually decreased.	yes

尽管这项改革方案引发了最近20多年来法国最大规模的社会风潮，但到目前为止，政府虽然对草案略有调整，但并没有做出任何重大让步。	Despite this reform proposal sparking the largest social movement in France in over 20 years, the government has so far made only minor adjustments to the draft and has not made any significant concessions.	no
工会已经准备在下周四也就是16日再次发起行动，3月7日，改革草案送交参议院讨论时，工会也计划组织示威行动。	The union is prepared to take action again on Thursday the 16th, and plans to organize a demonstration on March 7th when the reform bill is submitted to the Senate for discussion.	no

阿拉斯加上空被击落的 “物体”究竟是什么？	What exactly was the "object" that was shot down over Alaska?	yes
扑朔迷离，猜测纷纷	It's puzzling and full of speculation.	yes
美国军方周五（2月10日）下午再次动用美国最先进的隐身喷气战机F-22击落了一个在美国阿拉斯加上空飞行的尚未确定身份的物体。	On Friday (February 10), the US military once again used its most advanced stealth jet, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska.	yes
击落的地点距离阿拉斯加海岸十英里。	The location of the crash was ten miles off the coast of Alaska.	yes
这是美军在不到一周的时间里第二次击落空中飞行物体。	This was the second time in less than a week that the US military had shot down an airborne object.	yes
上周六，来自中国的一个间谍气球在美国领空上漂移数日后在美国南卡罗莱纳州沿岸附近上空被击毁。	Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China was destroyed over the coast of South Carolina, USA, after drifting in US airspace for several days.	yes
五角大楼说，第二个被击落的物体于周四晚上首次进入美国领空，在阿拉斯加东北部上空移动时被美国军方跟踪，飞行高度为1.2万米（4万英尺），其大小与一辆小型汽车差不多，与先前被击落的那个中国间谍气球相比要小很多。	The Pentagon stated that the second object that was shot down first entered US airspace on Thursday night. It was tracked by the US military as it moved over northeastern Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet). Its size was roughly that of a small car, much smaller compared to the previous Chinese spy balloon that was shot down.	yes
五角大楼还认为，目前没有迹象显示，这个物体是可操纵的。	The Pentagon also believes that there are currently no signs indicating that this object is manipulable.	yes
白宫国家安全委员会战略沟通协调员约翰·科比周五表示，虽然这个在高空飞行的物体的具体样子尚不清楚，但它“对民航飞机的安全构成了合理的威胁”。	John Kirby, the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, said on Friday that while the exact nature of the high-flying object was unclear, it posed a "reasonable threat to civil aviation safety."	yes
科比表示，这个物体与美国境内发现的那个间谍气球不同，它上面没有悬挂“有效载荷”。	Kobe stated that this object was different from the spy balloon found within the United States, as it did not have a "payload" attached to it.	yes
科比说，“我们把它称为一个‘物体’是我们目前能够作出的最好的描述”。	Kobe said, "Calling it an 'object' is the best description we can make at the moment."	no
拜登总统在下令击落这个物体之前听取了五角大楼的建议，他作出这个决定的时候“非常谨慎”，科比补充说。	President Biden took the advice of the Pentagon before ordering the object to be shot down, and he was "very cautious" in making this decision, Kobe added.	no
美国官方对这个物体的描述大致可以归纳为：大小相当于一辆小汽车，没有操纵杆，没有悬挂装置，飞行高度为一万米左右。	The official US description of the object can be roughly summarized as: the size of a small car, no control stick, no suspension device, and a flight altitude of about 10,000 meters.	no
但这些信息还无法回答基本问题，比如这个物体究竟是什么东西，它属于哪个国家，它在执行什么任务。	But this information still cannot answer basic questions, such as what exactly this object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is carrying out.	no
目前网上许多的分析和猜测认为，这可能又是一只中国气球。	Many online analyses and speculations currently suggest that this might be another Chinese balloon.	no
它可能与入侵美国领空的那只间谍气球和在拉美上空飘动的那只中国气球一样都来自中国，它们在不同地点执行某种任务。	It may have originated from China, like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, carrying out some sort of mission at different locations.	no
也有人把阿拉斯加的这个“物体”与“不明飞行物”（UFO）联系在一起。	Some people have linked this "object" in Alaska with "Unidentified Flying Objects" (UFOs).	no
美国新闻周刊的报道引用美国前众议员彼得·梅杰（Peter Meijer）周五在推特上发出的推文说，“真希望这个‘不明飞行物’也是一个间谍气球，而不是一个合法的UFO”。	A report by US Newsweek quoted a tweet from former US Congressman Peter Meijer on Friday saying, "I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO."	no
“将外星飞船与气象气球混为一谈的讽刺意味很令人惊讶，但这不值得引发一场星际冲突，”梅杰说。	"The irony of confusing alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it's not worth sparking an interstellar conflict," said Meijer.	no
梅杰是在科比证实阿拉斯加的这个物体被击落之后不久发出这个推文的。	Meijer tweeted this shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.	no
新闻周刊说，怀疑这个物体是UFO的不止是梅杰一人。	Newsweek reported that Meje was not the only one who suspected the object to be a UFO.	no
田纳西共和党籍众议员蒂姆·伯切特（Tim Burchett）批评政府上个月的掩盖情报的做法，要求国家情报总监办公室 (DNI)公布有关“不明飞行物”的报告。	Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month and called on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release reports on "unidentified flying objects".	no

这件衣服当时我们购买的时候是一件拉链帽衫，最后送给我确是一件短袖。	The clothing we bought at the time was a zip-up hoodie, but what was finally given to me was a short-sleeved shirt.	yes
收到衣服后立即与亚马逊客服取得了联系，当时确认衣服还是有库存的，我要求换货，客服说去解决一下，然后立即看到商品名称变成了短袖，原来我买的链接下架。	After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer service. At that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I requested an exchange, and the customer service said they would handle it. Then I immediately saw the product name changed to short sleeves, and the original link I bought was taken down.	yes
接着客服通知要么保留货品补偿一定金额，要么退货。	Then, the customer service notified to either keep the goods and compensate a certain amount, or return the goods.	yes
这就是亚马逊的处理方式？	Is this how Amazon handles it?	yes
真的很难以置信，本身衣物发错并不是我的问题，作为一个消费者我要求获得我应获得的商品，并没有提出什么很夸张的要求，亚马逊却改名字，说无库存。	It's really hard to believe that the wrong delivery of clothes is not my fault. As a consumer, I demand to receive the goods I should get, without making any exaggerated demands, yet Amazon changed the name and said there was no stock.	yes
这是我的第一个长评，希望这不是我的最后一个。	This is my first long review, I hope it's not my last.	yes
让人无法理解的袖子	The incomprehensible sleeve.	yes
说是牛皮的，也确实比较硬，但仔细看的话，局部有很多细小的裂痕，搞不清楚是否是真皮的，另外这个衣服的袖子真是让人无法理解，通常夹克的袖子要比衣摆长一些，不过通常也就1-2厘米，这件衣服足足长了5厘米，手臂自然下垂应该在手掌虎口的位置，但这件衣服的袖子都盖过手指了。	While it is said to be made of cowhide and is indeed quite hard, upon closer inspection, there are many small cracks in certain areas, making it unclear whether it is genuine leather. Additionally, the sleeves of this jacket are puzzling. Typically, the sleeves of a jacket are slightly longer than the hem, usually by 1-2 centimeters, but the sleeves of this jacket are a full 5 centimeters longer. When the arms are naturally hanging down, the sleeves should reach the base of the palm, but the sleeves of this jacket cover the fingers.	yes
买衣服容易，退货也容易。	Buying clothes is easy, and returning them is also easy.	yes
但是要退还钱真不知何时？	But when will the money be refunded?	yes
衣服做工不错，因为版型偏小，只得退货，但是退了货以后，至今一个多星期过去了，还没有收到退款？	The clothes were well made, but due to the small size, I had to return them. However, it's been over a week since I returned them and I still haven't received a refund?	yes
而且要购买者自已和那个诚信度不怎么样的全峰快递联系，这是自购亚马逊的物品以来最糟糕的一次购物！	Moreover, the buyer had to contact Quanfeng Express, a courier with a not-so-good reputation, on their own. This was the worst shopping experience since buying items from Amazon!	yes
但店家还是不错的，积极配合催促快递及时退款，但是这个全峰快递实在的工作是做的相当让人愤怒，拖拉半个月左右才退款，这种合作伙伴是要拖亚马逊的后腿的，工作效率差，没有服务意识！	However, the store was quite good, actively cooperating to urge the courier to refund in time, but the work of this Quanfeng Express was really infuriating, dragging on for about half a month before refunding. Such a partner is going to drag Amazon down, with poor work efficiency and no service awareness!	yes
更适合年轻人	More suitable for young people.	yes
99秒杀的。	It's a 99-second kill.	yes
毛裤的做工、颜色、手感都不错，柔软/薄厚适中，没有煤油味儿。	The craftsmanship, color, and feel of the woolen pants are all good, they are soft and of moderate thickness, and do not have a kerosene smell.	yes

3XL，平铺腰围2尺5，拉伸最大尺寸4尺，1.79/80公斤穿着腰有点紧。	3XL, with a flat waist circumference of 2.5 feet, maximum stretch size of 4 feet, is a bit tight around the waist for someone weighing 1.79/80 kilograms.	yes
似乎腰间没有松紧带，想加松点腰围还挺困难。	It seems there is no elastic waistband, so it's quite difficult to loosen the waist.	yes
另外，贴身穿是不舒服的。	Additionally, wearing tight clothes is uncomfortable.	yes
很好 颜色不是很鲜艳	Very good, the color is not very bright.	yes
刚买就涨了两百多，这是什么情况。	I just bought it and it's already increased by more than two hundred, what's going on?	yes
第一次亚马逊用的合作的天天烂快递，第一次送货没在家，后来主动和快递员约了两次送货时间，那个快递员都不送，后来直接给我退货了，这个该死的快递员一点诚信也没有，强烈建议不要再用那个天天烂快递了。	This was the first time Amazon used the cooperative courier service, Tian Tian Express, which was terrible. The first time they attempted delivery, I wasn't home. I then proactively arranged two delivery times with the courier, but they didn't deliver either time and eventually returned my package. This damn courier has no integrity at all. I strongly suggest not using Tian Tian Express anymore.	yes
这一次还有一件体恤衫也给我退货了，再拍也涨价了一百多元。	This time, a t-shirt was also returned to me, and if I were to buy it again, the price has increased by more than a hundred yuan.	yes
亚马逊自营不应该出现这样商品	Such products should not appear on Amazon's self-operated platform.	yes
产品特价的时候购买，价格不低，看评论也是很不错的产品。	The product was purchased on sale, the price was not low, and the reviews also indicated that it was a very good product.	yes
实际收到产品的时候让我目瞪口呆，商品表面大面积磨损，多处其他地方都有磨损，不是次品就是旧品，稍后上图。	When I actually received the product, I was dumbfounded. The product had large areas of wear on the surface and multiple other areas were worn. It was either a substandard product or a used one. I will upload pictures later.	yes
我申请退货，厂家的人看到图片后说是运输导致，这不是瞎说吗？	I requested a return, and the manufacturer's representative said it was due to transportation after seeing the picture. Isn't that a baseless claim?	yes
商品内部怎么可能磨损？	How could the inside of a product possibly wear out?	yes
只有两种可能，要么次品旧品，要么就是我故意损坏商品，然后拿去退货。	There are only two possibilities, either the goods are substandard or old, or I deliberately damaged the goods and then returned them.	yes
客观来讲，我没有证据证明我没有损坏商品，但是以我在亚马逊购物的信用记录来讲，我认为这样的商品不应该出现在亚马逊自营商品中，客户选择亚马逊自营就是信任，customer win，we win，客户的胜利就是厂商的胜利，希望大家一起努力改进，谢谢。	Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the product, but based on my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I believe such products should not appear in Amazon's self-operated products. Customers choose Amazon's self-operated products because they trust them. When the customer wins, we win. The customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory. I hope everyone will work together to improve. Thank you.	yes
我使用该产品不到一年，就出现两个E2，我不知道如何处理?	I have been using this product for less than a year and have encountered two E2 errors, I don't know how to handle it?	yes
我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?	I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the right two groups of the receiver often showed a red E2, which should be a problem with the transmitter module. This doesn't quite match what Amazon's website says about the transmitter module being able to work continuously for 7 years. I can't find after-sales service on Amazon's website, so I don't know what to do?	yes
还行吧	It's okay.	yes
第一次购买是坏的。	The first purchase was bad.	yes
感觉不像新的。	It doesn't feel new.	yes
盒子上的标签被撕了，机身上标签也破了。	The label on the box was torn off, and the label on the body was also broken.	yes
而且老是白屏。	And it keeps going to a white screen.	yes
换了以后好了。	It got better after changing it.	yes
换货挺迅速，晚上有点模糊，视角不是很广，但是普通家用够了。	The exchange was quite fast, it's a bit blurry at night, the field of view is not very wide, but it's enough for regular home use.	yes
不足就是没有卡，自己买的，还有就是以前在亚马逊买过手机。	The downside is that it doesn't come with a card, I had to buy it myself, and I have previously bought a phone on Amazon.	yes
包装上会有贴纸，防止包装被打开，这次没有，买手机时候还有个贴纸一样的章，可以贴在保修卡上，这次没有。	There would usually be a sticker on the packaging to prevent it from being opened, but this time there wasn't. When buying a phone, there would also be a sticker-like seal that could be attached to the warranty card, but this time there wasn't.	yes
不知道是不是东西便宜了就没有，很困惑。	I'm not sure if things are no longer available because they're cheap, it's very confusing.	yes
等待供货商回复	Waiting for a response from the supplier.	yes
包装没有任何标识，直接给供货商致电说，回答没标识是正品，如怀疑可用边角料邮寄到强生公司验货，还留下车牌号以及电话号码，承诺会发短信通知把我的信息输入强生官网保修卡，到现在也没收到短信啊？	The packaging had no markings, so I called the supplier directly. They said that the lack of markings indicated that it was genuine, and if I had doubts, I could send a sample to Johnson & Johnson for verification. They also left their license plate number and phone number, promising to send a text message to notify me that my information had been entered into the Johnson & Johnson warranty card on their official website, but I haven't received a text message yet?	yes
上午收到机油，下午就换上了。	Received the engine oil in the morning and replaced it in the afternoon.	yes
第二次购买。	The second purchase.	yes
亚马逊自营商品还是很放心的。	Amazon's self-operated products are very reliable.	yes
换油的师傅说油品清亮，确实是好油 。	The mechanic who changed the oil said that the oil was clear and indeed good quality.	yes
因为是第二次购买了。	Because it was the second time I made a purchase.	yes
所以还是很放心的。	So it's still very reassuring.	yes
快递飞速，包装没有挑剔的地方，用了这个油，发动机声音明显下降。	The delivery was fast, the packaging had no faults, and after using this oil, the engine noise noticeably decreased.	yes
性价比不错，二百以下很难找到合成机油。	The cost-performance ratio is good, it's hard to find synthetic motor oil for less than 200.	yes
支持星冠，支持胜牌，对车有效保护。	Support the star crown, support the winning card, effectively protect the car.	yes
日本亚马逊因为客服问题导致买家的利益严重受损（8c的毛毛虫发货为8cm的毛毛虫）（8c=14cm，8cm=2c）	Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service issues (delivering an 8cm caterpillar instead of an 8c caterpillar) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c).	yes
承认错误，但是一直在推诿，始终强调货物为第三方，不能约束第三方。	Admitting the mistake, but always evading, constantly emphasizing that the goods belong to a third party and cannot bind the third party.	yes
订单编号：503-4265464-1830254。	Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.	yes
我当初购买的页面尺码选项为7c，8，9c，当时觉得这就是个陷阱，打电话给日亚中文客服，明确告知8就是8c，但是等商品回到中国才发现，只有8cm，我觉得这完全是故意设下的陷阱来坑中国人（按照亚马逊的售后），现在查看页面已没有这个选项。	When I originally purchased, the size options on the page were 7c, 8, 9c. I thought this was a trap, so I called Amazon's Chinese customer service and was clearly told that 8 meant 8c. However, when the product arrived back in China, I found out it was only 8cm. I believe this was a trap deliberately set to scam Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service). Now, this option is no longer available on the page.	yes
中方客服：很抱歉，给你带来损失了，我们给你两条路走：	Chinese customer service: We apologize for the inconvenience caused, we offer you two options:	yes
1，你退货，买家承担所有运费。	You return the goods, the buyer bears all shipping costs.	yes
2，你不退货，我们补偿你1000日元。	If you don't return the item, we will compensate you with 1000 yen.	yes
（我算一下账，鞋子4000多日元，算作200rmb，选择1，我没有鞋子，损失在200元。	(Let me do the math, the shoes cost more than 4000 yen, which is about 200 RMB. If I choose option 1, I don't have the shoes, so the loss is 200 yuan.	yes
选择2，我有鞋子，最后补偿了我2000日元，最后损失在150rmb 客服：我们已记录下来，我们会认真处理，次日回了封邮件，说我不接受中方客服调解，就这么完了。	I chose option 2, I have the shoes, and was finally compensated 2000 yen, with a final loss of 150 RMB. Customer service: We have recorded this, we will handle it seriously, and the next day they sent an email saying that if I do not accept mediation from the Chinese customer service, then it's over.	yes
我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	I proposed: When purchasing pages with confusing options like 7c, 8, 9c, the Chinese customer service told me that the commonly used codes in Japan do not include 'c', similar to 140, but have you guys ever looked at other caterpillar pages?	yes
都有美码，日码混标的情况出现。	There are cases where American and Japanese codes are mixed.	no
再说，你8cm为什么放在7c和9c中间，明明最小的尺码，你放那里算什么意思。	Moreover, why did you place 8cm between 7c and 9c? It's clearly the smallest size, what's the point of putting it there?	no
中方客服：我们提供中文服务，但是不知道你要运回国，所以你的运费我们是不予理赔的。	Chinese Customer Service: We provide services in Chinese, but we didn't know you wanted to ship back to your country, so we will not compensate for your shipping costs.	no
这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	I don't understand this logic. I am Japanese, and I need Chinese customer service. Chinese living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service. Tourists in Japan don't have the time to make international calls. So the question is, who needs to call Amazon's overseas Chinese service? It's probably just people like me who shop on Japanese Amazon.	no
亚马逊中文客服不就是方便了我们海淘的这些人吗？	Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just to facilitate us, the overseas online shoppers?	no
这次购买不是很满意	I am not very satisfied with this purchase.	yes
这是第二次从亚马逊上购买帮宝适尿布，曾经在宝宝2个月的时候买过一箱，选择了欧洲进口纸张的尿布，第一次购买经历还是比较满意的，宝宝整夜就用一张尿布，的确可以满足12个小时不换尿布。	This is the second time I've purchased Pampers diapers from Amazon. I bought a box when my baby was two months old, choosing diapers made from European imported paper. The first purchase experience was quite satisfactory, as my baby could use one diaper for the whole night, indeed meeting the need of not changing diapers for 12 hours.	yes
但是这次购买L号的尿布，一箱里面有2包分开包装，打开后就觉得纸张比较松，跟进口帮宝适有明显区别，给宝宝用了之后，还算可以，没有漏尿也没有红疹等迹象。	However, this time I bought size L diapers, there were 2 separate packages in a box. After opening, I felt that the paper was looser, which was significantly different from the imported Pampers. After using them for my baby, they were okay, with no signs of leakage or rash.	yes
但是到了第二包尿布，开始使用后宝宝的大腿内侧立马就出现了红疹，至今还没有褪去。	However, after starting the second pack of diapers, a rash immediately appeared on the inside of the baby's thighs and has not yet faded.	yes
怀疑1箱里面的2包，质量还不一样啊。	I suspect that the quality of the two packages in one box is not the same.	yes
以后应该不会继续购买了！	I probably won't continue to buy in the future!	yes
希望重视包裹的运输保护	Emphasize the importance of package transportation protection.	yes
这是我网购这么久以来，看到最差的一次包装运输，完全没有什么保护措施，缓冲泡沫，包裹缓冲层材料等，什么都没有。	This is the worst packaging and shipping I've seen in all my time shopping online, with absolutely no protective measures, no bubble wrap, no cushioning material, nothing at all.	yes
就一个压变形的箱子。	Regarding a deformed box under pressure.	yes
而且里面的软胶盒包装的，卡盒都压开了压到变形了。	Moreover, the soft rubber boxes inside were packaged in such a way that the card boxes were squashed and deformed.	yes
希望是正品 质量有保证，以后是不怎么敢亚马孙买东西的了。	I hope it's genuine and the quality is guaranteed, I'm not very confident in buying things from Amazon in the future.	yes
宁愿国内贵一半，有保障点。	I'd rather pay half more domestically for some assurance.	yes
而且商品产品包装问题，我看评论2016年就有人评论过，到现在19年，还是老样子。	Moreover, regarding the issue of product packaging, I saw comments from as early as 2016, and now in 2019, it's still the same.	yes
说明亚马逊根本就不重视服务反馈这一块，和国内的京东、天猫等差太远了。	This indicates that Amazon does not value service feedback at all, which is far behind domestic companies like JD.com and Tmall.	yes
好看，但有点点小遗憾	It's nice, but there's a slight regret.	yes
整个杯子的颜色是我狠喜欢的，橘红色，虽然我家是男宝，但是还是觉得橘红配黄色很亮眼。	The entire cup is in a color I really like, orange-red, even though I have a boy at home, I still think orange-red paired with yellow is very eye-catching.	yes
比我想象的小一些，不过本来就是拿来带出门用的，所以还可以接受。	It's a bit smaller than I imagined, but it's meant to be portable, so it's still acceptable.	yes
昨晚拿回家试了一下，瓶盖推开之后，吸管和盖子之间的距离太近了，因为吸管的位置是正向垂直的，所以儿子总是要把盖子上面的凸起含住喝水，觉得这个地方是否可以改进一下。	I brought it home to try last night, and after opening the bottle cap, I found that the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the position of the straw is vertically straight, my son always has to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water. I wonder if this could be improved.	yes
看来其他牌子的吸管杯把吸管做的倾斜还是有道理的，小孩子的东西，真的就是在乎安全和舒适。	It seems that other brands of straw cups make the straw slanted for a reason. When it comes to children's items, safety and comfort really do matter.	yes
轻便大容量	Lightweight and high capacity.	yes
喜欢它轻便，开口大，就是两个独立的分隔袋对我来说有点多余，感觉不知道装什么好。	I like its lightness and large opening, but the two separate compartments seem a bit redundant to me, as I'm not sure what to put in them.	yes
买完发现海外购美亚上还有一只另一个牌子很类似的，才不到两百块。	After purchasing, I found another similar brand on the overseas shopping platform, Amazon, for less than two hundred yuan.	yes
假货，假的特别厉害	Fake goods, especially those that are extremely counterfeit.	yes
亚马逊卖假货，我也是服了。	I can't believe Amazon sells counterfeit goods.	yes
客服说因为用了所以不能退货，我没用怎么知道是假货。	The customer service said that because I used it, I couldn't return it. How would I know it was a fake if I didn't use it?	yes
因为信任，所以伤心，毕竟是抹脸的用品，真的去实体店买吧，认可贵一点。	Because of trust, there is sadness. After all, it's a facial product. It's better to buy it in a physical store, even if it's a bit more expensive.	yes
因为是秒杀，所以没有看评论，我已经提交国家工商总局的电商平台了，我们一起维权吧。	Because it was a flash sale, I didn't look at the reviews. I have already submitted a complaint to the National Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform. Let's protect our rights together.	yes
坏了？	Is it broken?	yes
假货？	Fake goods?	yes
总之悲剧。	In short, a tragedy.	yes
用第二片的时候选的毛孔细致的，但是一打开就一股怪味，以为是正常的，因为没用过这款，然后往脸上贴的时候就整个受不了了，非常冲的味道，无法形容，熏到立马咳嗽了出来，眼睛也很痛，流眼泪，马上摘了去洗脸。	When I used the second sheet, I chose one with fine pores, but as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used this brand before. However, when I applied it to my face, I couldn't stand it. The smell was very strong and indescribable. It made me cough immediately, and my eyes were very painful and teary. I immediately took it off and washed my face.	yes
不信邪又开了一片同款的，没有那么重的味道了，现在正在敷。	I tried another one of the same kind, it didn't have such a strong smell, and I'm using it now.	yes
回想起有点像发廊里劣质烫发水的味道。	It reminded me a bit of the smell of cheap perm solution in a hair salon.	yes
真无法想象，难倒亚马逊自营的护肤品从此也得避而远之了吗？	It's hard to imagine, will Amazon's own skincare products also have to be avoided from now on?	yes
奸商啊	Unscrupulous merchant.	yes
当时购买的时候，活动页面上是说满99元赠送“三体全集”，收到货没有这个赠品，打客服电话说要给他们看当时活动的截图，问题是谁买东西还把网页截图保存啊，你们自己做过的活动，还需要顾客帮你们提供啊，各位买家下次要留个心眼，保存证据。	When I made the purchase, the promotion on the page said that a "Three-Body Trilogy" would be given for free with purchases over 99 yuan. However, I did not receive this gift when I received the goods. When I called customer service, they asked me to show them a screenshot of the promotion at the time. The problem is, who saves screenshots of web pages when they make purchases? You need customers to provide evidence for promotions you have run yourself. Buyers, be careful next time and keep evidence.	yes
用后感受	Post-use experience.	yes
第一次在亚马逊买东西，分别感受有几点，先来说下用完商品的感受吧，第一确实是无痛，也没有刺激味道的东西，总体来说很不错的，静等8分钟左右一擦就掉了，只是会有少量的汗毛渣在上面，不细看是看不出来的，所以说总体是不错的，至于之后都就用一次还要继续观察，继续用才会知道。	This was my first time shopping on Amazon, and I had several impressions. Let's start with my experience after using the product. Firstly, it was indeed painless and there was no irritating smell, overall it was quite good. After waiting for about 8 minutes, the hair came off easily, although there were a few small hair residues left, which were not noticeable unless you looked closely. So overall, it was good. As for the future, I will need to continue observing and using it to know more.	yes
反正我觉得这个东西确实不错。	Anyway, I think this thing is really good.	yes
第二从27号下单，12号收到货，总共15天也就是半个月，亚马逊的送货员服务态度也很好。	The second order was placed on the 27th and received on the 12th, a total of 15 days or half a month. The delivery service from Amazon was also very good.	yes
第三，亚马逊的什么黑色星期五就不要相信了，星期五下单，等了2天就便宜了接近12块钱，也就是我买成170多（加上运费什么的），有一种搞活动就提价格的感觉样。	Thirdly, don't trust Amazon's Black Friday deals. I placed an order on Friday and after waiting for two days, the price dropped by nearly $12, meaning I paid over $170 (including shipping), which gives the impression that they raise prices during sales.	yes
客服说什么价格波动，我关注了10多天价格也就是这个样，波动也不大的。	The customer service mentioned price fluctuations, but I've been monitoring for over 10 days and the price has been pretty stable.	yes
价格实惠，日原产，有中文标签，带颗粒，绝对回购！	Affordable, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, granulated, definitely a repurchase!	yes
膏体里带颗粒的，清爽感恰到好处，用后牙齿爽滑，上比某二手东强太多啦，那里说是进口的东西，可好多东西没有中文标签，不知从哪里批发的。	The paste with granules in it has just the right refreshing feel. After using it, the teeth feel smooth. It's much better than some second-hand stuff, which claims to be imported, but many items don't have Chinese labels, and it's unclear where they are wholesaled from.	yes
以后只要亚马逊有的，绝不再去二手东。	From now on, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to second-hand Dong again.	yes
给个建议，亚马逊的app 上晒单怎么有时晒不了，希望能改进一些应用，会做的越来越好的！	Here's a suggestion, sometimes I can't post reviews on the Amazon app, I hope some improvements can be made to the application, it will get better and better!	yes
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	The service has been getting worse over the years, there is simply no quality to speak of!	yes
垃圾卓越不顾及客户需求 下订单的时候特别配送时间19:00-22:00。	The garbage excellence disregards customer needs when placing an order, especially the delivery time from 19:00 to 22:00.	yes
因家里有术后卧床不方便的老人在，所以只有晚上可以方便收件。	Due to having an elderly person at home who is bedridden after surgery, it is only convenient to receive packages in the evening.	yes
结果竟然中午12点就直接上门送了，也不事先电话告知。	Surprisingly, they delivered it directly to the door at noon without giving any prior notice by phone.	yes
如果配送时间是你们快递员随心所欲的想几点就几点送，何必假惺惺弄个时间让客户选择？	If the delivery time is at the whim of your couriers, why bother pretending to let customers choose a time?	yes
如果自己的物流没办法保证服务的，那就干脆不要做电商了！	If your own logistics can't guarantee service, then you might as well not do e-commerce at all!	yes
让一个身上3处伤口的老人下床开门收快递还要找零钱付费！	Making an elderly person with three wounds get out of bed to answer the door and pay for a delivery is outrageous!	yes
明明订单上有联系电话！	The contact number is clearly on the order!	yes
从头到底也没有人来电话联系一下给个解释！	No one bothered to call and give an explanation from start to finish!	yes
卓越网所谓的投诉客服就是一帮子外地人在那里装样子，敷衍你的投诉然后给你一个所谓的答复。	The so-called customer service of Excellence Network is just a group of outsiders pretending to handle your complaints and then giving you a so-called response.	yes
不会有任何改变或者补偿！	There will be no changes or compensation!	no
之前也是遇到这样子了类似配送时间不对的问题也就忍了，但这次无法忍受，太过分了！	I had encountered similar issues with incorrect delivery times before and tolerated it, but this time it's unbearable, it's too much!	no
新书买的预售到货后竟然封面和封底是反的，这样子明显得质量问题就这样子闭眼把书发给顾客了？	The new book I pre-ordered arrived with the front and back covers reversed. How could they overlook such an obvious quality issue and send the book to the customer like this?	no
留言差评也不会有人来联系你。	Leaving a negative review will not result in anyone contacting you.	no
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	The service has been getting worse over the years, there is simply no quality to speak of!	no
不会再在卓越上花一毛钱。	I will not spend another penny on excellence.	no
图片质量实在不能接受	The image quality is simply unacceptable.	yes
作为“古地图集”这样的标题，本书在图片的选择、排版、印刷上实在令人难以接受，有些图片甚至有马赛克，模糊到无法辨识。	As a title like "Ancient Atlas", the choice of images, layout, and printing in this book is really unacceptable, with some images even having mosaics, blurred to the point of being unrecognizable.	yes
即便本书不是专业的地图册，即便是小画幅插图，也应该对得起目录中祖先留下来的洋洋大观的中古文献资料！	Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small format illustration, it should do justice to the grand collection of medieval literature left by our ancestors in the catalogue!	yes
（况且很多图片是可以从相关行业资源中获取清晰的原始文件的），用这样的图片来拼凑图书与不使用图片有何差别？	(And many images can be obtained from relevant industry resources in clear original files), what's the difference between using such images to piece together a book and not using images at all?	yes
！我为这样的治学精神感到遗憾。	I regret such an attitude towards scholarship.	yes
文字方面不予评价，方家各有分辨。	In terms of text, no judgment is made, each family has its own discernment.	yes
整体2星。	Overall 2 stars.	yes
高二的时候看的这本书当时只是抱着无聊看看玩的心态，感觉这样的书自己应该不会沉迷吧，毕竟起点的网文以往还是不太吸引我的。	When I read this book in my second year of high school, I was just reading it out of boredom. I didn't think I would get addicted to such a book, after all, web novels from Qidian have never been that appealing to me.	yes
然后...就掉坑里了。	And then... fell into a pit.	yes
按着这个剧情来说，整本书都是比较轻松愉快的，前部分叶修还在网游里的时候，即使是公会之间勾心斗角，也因为往往被叶神狗血，搞得一点也不沉重。	According to this plot, the whole book is quite relaxed and enjoyable. In the early part when Ye Xiu is still in the online game, even the intrigue between guilds is not heavy because it is often made light-hearted by Ye's antics.	yes
至于到了比赛的部分，写出了时代的变迁新旧交替的一点点心酸之感（可能是我多愁善感）。	As for the competition part, it conveyed a bit of the bittersweet feeling of the changing times and the transition from old to new (perhaps I'm just sentimental).	yes
看整部书花了我高二许多学习时间，可是就是停不下来。	Reading the entire book took up a lot of my study time in my second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.	yes
全职对人物和感情线的描写让人十分惊艳，有的人物只是偶尔带过，也会给人留下很深的影响，像比较重点描写的角色叶修黄少天苏沐橙都有大量的粉丝，而不在写作中心的角色例如江波涛楚云秀等等也十分找人喜欢，在一个电竞的爽文中竟然让人找不到一个让人讨厌至极的人物，这是全职在人物描写上的成功。	The full-time description of characters and emotional lines is very impressive. Some characters are just occasionally mentioned, but they also leave a deep impression. Characters like Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mucheng, who are more focused on, have a large number of fans. Characters not at the center of the writing, such as Jiang Botao and Chu Yunxiu, are also very popular. In an e-sports text, it is surprising that there is not a single character that is extremely disliked. This is the success of full-time in character description.	yes
而在感情线上，全职也没有一般网文所令人诟病的后宫佳丽三千万要么美女要么腐的毛病，全文所有人的感情，都有一个共同的地方就是他们喜欢着荣耀这个游戏，并且大都想要堂堂正正的胜利。	In terms of emotional storyline, unlike the common criticism of harem and beauty or decay in general web novels, all the characters in Full-Time share a common love for the game Glory, and most of them desire a fair and square victory.	yes
小计量有却没有什么大阴谋，每个人看上去都那么单纯可爱。	There are small amounts but no big conspiracies, everyone seems so innocent and lovely.	yes
这或许也是为什么全职没有什么令人讨厌的角色。	Perhaps this is why there are no particularly annoying characters in Full Time.	yes
全职的IP很大，也归功于此。	The full-time IP is also large, thanks to this.	yes
撇开网文这个文化现象不谈，全职不失为一本不错的书。	Setting aside the cultural phenomenon of online literature, Full-Time is a pretty good book.	no
多少他真的会给人提供一些热血，一点点感动。	To some extent, he really does provide some passion and a bit of emotion to people.	no
今年4月份全职要动漫化。	This April, the full-time job will be turned into an anime.	no
其实想要买齐这套书很久了，碍于永远钱包不够厚都没狠下心下手，然后想要买的时候就发现，tb上简直是假货猖獗，其实全职最近出了另一个版本，封面图吧我自己是蛮喜欢的，但还是打算先买老的版本，所以就在亚马逊上看了看，一次性买下来了一套。	I've wanted to buy this set of books for a long time, but I've always been held back by the lack of money. When I finally decided to buy it, I found that there were a lot of fakes on tb. In fact, a new version of the full-time job has recently been released, and I quite like the cover, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I looked at it on Amazon and bought a set all at once.	no
接下来简单说一下货的情况。	Let's briefly discuss the situation with the goods.	no
●第四本的塑封没有，但书是新的。	The fourth book does not have a plastic wrap, but the book is new.	no
●第十七本塑封是在但是被打开了，书的质感也很奇怪感觉没有其他的硬。	The seventeenth book was sealed in plastic but was opened, and the texture of the book felt strange and not as hard as the others.	no
●第23本和第十七本情况一样，但是也比第十七本硬，但十分的旧。	The 23rd book is similar to the 17th one, but it is also harder than the 17th one, and it is very old.	no
●个别几本书的出版社不同好像第23和17就是同一个出版社，和其他的不同。	The publishers of a few individual books seem to be different, for example, the 23rd and 17th are from the same publisher, which is different from the others.	no
●整体来讲还算满意，24本很大一箱，很满足。	Overall, I'm quite satisfied. A box of 24 is quite large and very satisfying.	no
落寞的小狮子	The Lonely Little Lion	yes
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner," but there turned out to be a lot of text!	yes
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	It took three readings to finish this book for the child, about a little lion who can shoot and loves to eat gummy candies.	yes
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	When seeing the scene where the lion eats the hunter, there is a slight discomfort, as modern city dwellers have a hard time accepting such a scenario of being eaten by animals.	yes
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	In the end, this little lion, who had succeeded in human society, lost himself. He was no longer a complete lion, nor a complete human.	yes
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	In the end, only the little lion's silhouette was left, and it was unknown where he had gone.	yes
可能多年以后，这个小狮子的形象还留在长大了的小朋友的印象中，在某一天不经意的时候被想起，或许对她会有触动或是启发。	Perhaps years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the impressions of grown-up children, being recalled inadvertently one day, and may touch or inspire them.	yes
性价比很高的作品集	A very cost-effective portfolio.	yes
1、以前还不知道TASCHEN，最近买了不少他们的书，原因就是太强悍，不论是选题还是制作本身。	I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but recently I've bought quite a few of their books because they are so impressive, both in terms of the topics they choose and the production itself.	yes
本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	There have been three versions of this work, the largest of which is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide, similar to the complete works of Michelangelo; the medium version is approximately 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and comes with a two-volume book box.	yes
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	Personally, I find it acceptable. Firstly, it's affordable and the 700-plus pages are divided into two volumes, making it easier to flip through as a paperback. Secondly, unlike the complete works of Michelangelo, this book of Da Vinci is predominantly filled with black and white manuscripts. For readers with a limited budget and non-art majors, this edition offers the highest cost-performance ratio for appreciating artworks and manuscripts.	yes
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	The commentary on the painting section is excellent, with composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as The Last Supper), but due to either printing or book size issues, some shadow parts are too dark to see the details, which is a bit regrettable.	yes
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	Compared to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscripts are much more abundant in content.	yes
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius, the latter's wide range of interests and high achievements are not enough to describe as a genius.	yes
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	If before one could only appreciate half of Da Vinci through his paintings, after seeing his manuscripts, one would be completely speechless.	yes
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Trash, whoever buys it will regret it!	yes
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	I never give bad reviews, but this is genuinely rubbish. It's a waste of money. Give me a reason!	yes
1.走时不准，突然变成1月1号，时间归零了。	The time was not accurate, it suddenly turned to January 1st, and the time was reset to zero.	yes
2.劣质皮带，都不是硅胶的，带了手腕过敏起泡。	Inferior quality belts, which are not made of silicone, can cause allergic reactions and blisters on the wrist.	yes
3.经常连不上手机。	3. Often unable to connect to the mobile phone.	yes
4.续航只有五天。	The battery life is only five days.	yes
5.睡眠检测不显示，时间是0。	Sleep detection does not display, the time is 0.	yes
6.不防水。	Not waterproof.	yes
7.其他。	7. Others.	yes
物流太慢	The logistics are too slow.	yes
显示10月16号到，结果21号才收到，差评！	It was supposed to arrive on October 16th, but I only received it on the 21st. Bad review!	yes
快递太差，亚马逊上买东西本来就慢，没想到会这么慢！	The delivery is too bad, buying things on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow!	yes
总体满意	Overall satisfaction.	yes
之前一开始还担心相机的包装，这次还好，里面有充气包，相机三码一致，也能在官网注册，快门次数0，其余的就只能等时间检验了 。	Initially, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was fine. There was an airbag inside, the camera's three codes matched, and it could be registered on the official website. The shutter count was zero, and the rest would have to be tested over time.	yes
发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	The delivery speed was quite fast, but I have to complain about the courier. He left the valuable item at the door and left quickly. I had no chance to open the box and check it in front of him, which left me speechless.	yes
商家发货前做到了为客户着想:)	The merchant has considered the customer's needs before shipping :)	yes
商家比较负责，专门打电话问所用相机的屏幕尺寸，确实替客户着想了。	The merchant was quite responsible, specifically calling to ask about the screen size of the camera used, truly considering the customer's needs.	yes
发货速度也快。	The delivery speed is also fast.	yes
金刚膜贴上去也挺合适和管用的。	The diamond film fits quite well and is effective.	yes
电池充不满	The battery is not fully charged.	yes
机器确实不错，想问下怎么第一次充电起就充不满啊，充电指示灯一直红色	The machine is indeed good, but I want to ask why it can't be fully charged the first time, the charging indicator light is always red.	yes
目前找不到亚马逊官方反馈渠道，所以只能在商品评价里反馈	Currently, there is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so feedback can only be given in product reviews.	yes
1. 在 3 月 29 号，通过预购途径使用 31 元购买了此书，显示 3 月 31 号会推送到设备上，此时亚马逊官网上还无法预览该书（因为还未发布）；	On March 29, I pre-ordered this book for 31 yuan, which showed it would be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book could not be previewed on the Amazon official website (because it had not yet been released).	yes
2. 3 月 31 号推送到设备上的书，内容是空白，只有敬请期待，而亚马逊上该书电子版降价到了 18 元；	The book pushed to the device on March 31st was blank, with only a "coming soon" message, and the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced to 18 yuan.	yes
3. 这两天反复尝试将设备上的下载的空白的书进行删除，再次同步，都无法获取到包含实际内容的电子版《商业的本质》，但是看到亚马逊官网已经可以预览该书。	I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank books downloaded on the device and sync again over the past two days, but I have been unable to obtain the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" containing actual content. However, I see that the book can already be previewed on the Amazon official website.	yes
目前我有几点感想	Currently, I have a few thoughts.	yes
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	The issue of price is not the most important, the key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books of actual content, rather than always downloading "coming soon".	yes
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	I probably won't buy pre-ordered books in the future, after all, if it gets postponed, downloading an empty book seems very complicated.	yes
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	I hope Amazon can provide a proper channel for feedback on such issues, so that there is a place to voice concerns when there are doubts about e-book downloads or usage (tickets, online customer service, etc. can be used, you can refer to how the Microsoft official store does it).	yes
不是很推荐阅读	Not highly recommended for reading.	yes
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	I read it a long time ago, and just happened to see it. I'll write some thoughts from memory.	yes
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	This book is less a collection of short stories, and more a collection of fragments about love from life.	yes
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The tone of this book is extremely plain, like that of plain water, with the pursuit of simplicity in word choice and sentence construction taken to the extreme, and the plot is as quiet and plain as a street on a summer afternoon.	yes
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Each short story is a snapshot of a small moment in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.	yes
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	Finally collected together, it was titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."	yes
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I think, this collection of stories, as well as its title, is like a kind of performance art. The author wants to express that love is not just the joys and sorrows on the stage, the eternal love in urban legends, or the inseparable intimacy between lovers. Love is not only the above and should not be represented by the above. Love is also a life as plain as water, a boring day after day, as well as the helplessness towards life, the escape from reality, and the confusion about the future.	yes
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	While reading this book, you may recall the quarrelling couple beside you, the bland marriages of people you know, and unsatisfactory relationships.	yes
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	This is exactly why I do not recommend reading it. From an aesthetic perspective, the writing and plot of this book are bland and tasteless, unless your life is tumultuous or sweet as living in a candy castle, otherwise, your feeling when reading it would be indifferent and bored.	yes
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	From a depth of thought perspective, the everyday plot does not dazzle or expand one's thinking and perspective (unlike Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief segments do not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?	yes
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?	no
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much difference whether you read it or not.	no
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	The author's ideas are more expressed through techniques and genres rather than the story plot, which is a reason why the reading experience of this book is relatively poor.	no
适合粗读,不能细看。	Suitable for skimming, not for detailed reading.	yes
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	The logic of this book is good, but the content is not rich enough.	yes
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	Many sales theories explain what and why, but are weak in terms of how to do it, only pointing out the direction but not providing specific methods.	yes
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	Additionally, this book feels like it was pieced together.	yes
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	Examples include both domestic and foreign; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and those who are not well-known.	yes
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	It is unclear whether the stories were compiled for illustrative purposes, but examples from the author's personal experience would be more convincing.	yes
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	The terminology fluctuates between "customer" and "client".	yes
标题上还是顾客,正文中就变成客户了。	The title still refers to the customer, but in the body of the text, it has changed to client.	yes
电子书中还出现了错别字、标点符号缺失、编号错误的问题。	The e-book also had issues with typos, missing punctuation, and numbering errors.	yes
总之,这本书作为理论入门是个不错的选择,但对于已经从事销售工作想要提高销售水平的人就不太适用了。	In summary, this book is a good choice for beginners in theory, but not quite suitable for those already in sales who want to improve their sales level.	yes
快速了解互联网金融的导读书	A guidebook for quickly understanding internet finance.	yes
这本书很浅，可以说只是一个入门课，可以帮助大家快速了解互联网金融的全貌，但要深入了解，还是要按图索骥，自己去深挖。	This book is quite basic, it can be said to be an introductory course, it can help everyone quickly understand the full picture of internet finance, but to understand in depth, you still need to follow the clues and dig deeper on your own.	yes
且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	Moreover, the book was written quite early, and it does not mention the later subsidy wars between Alipay and WeChat to cultivate user habits. The current market share of third-party payments is probably much larger than what is mentioned in the book.	yes
现在好多人外出吃饭都是带个手机就好，商家也因为银行流水太高的原因，弃用银联了。	Nowadays, many people just bring their mobile phones when they go out to eat, and because of the high bank turnover, merchants have abandoned UnionPay.	yes
但还是非常感谢作者写出这本入门书，看得出作者起码有多年的金融观察经验，对国内外的金融发展史都十分熟悉，所以才能写成如此通俗易懂的内容。	Still, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It is clear that the author has many years of experience observing finance and is very familiar with the history of financial development both domestically and abroad, which is why he was able to write such accessible content.	yes
写高大空很容易，难的是写的通俗易懂。	It's easy to write grandiloquently, the challenge is to write in a way that's easy to understand.	yes
欣赏你，更想让你知道！	I admire you, and I want you to know it!	yes
决定一个人工作满意度的第一要素不是薪水高低，而是在工作中是否得到了足够重视和赏识。	The primary factor determining a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they receive enough recognition and appreciation in their work.	yes
根据马斯洛需求层次理论，在人的基本生存需要得到满足后，最迫切的就是心理需要的满足——希望被理解、被肯定、被赏识。	According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, once a person's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.	yes
确实，对于国人来说，大部分是“爱你在心口难开”，即便是怀有爱、感激与赞赏也是默默放在心里不会说出来。	Indeed, for most Chinese people, love is often "kept in the heart and hard to express," even feelings of love, gratitude, and appreciation are silently kept in the heart and not spoken out loud.	yes
作者在本书中阐述了五种赞赏的语言：肯定的言辞、精心时刻、服务的行为、称心的礼物、身体接触。	The author elaborates on five languages of appreciation in this book: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, receiving gifts, and physical touch.	yes
我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	I think what's important is not knowing what the five languages of appreciation are, but being able to genuinely use these five languages to appreciate and be grateful for the people around you, whether they are family, friends or colleagues.	yes
其实越是亲密的人越需要赞赏和感恩，这样我们的生活才会变得更加美好。	In fact, the closer the person, the more they need appreciation and gratitude, which will make our lives better.	yes
学会赞赏，企业也能在一定程度上挽留住人才，降低辞职率。	By learning to appreciate, companies can also retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.	yes
感谢译者给我们带来了精彩的国外的思想和世界。	Thanks to the translators for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and world views.	yes
由于中西方文化背景等原因，语言之间或多或少会存在差异，如果有机会能看到作者原版相信会收获更多。	Due to differences in cultural backgrounds between the East and the West, there are more or less differences between languages. If there is a chance to see the original version of the author, I believe more will be gained.	yes
再次谢谢作者和译者以及编辑们的辛勤劳动！	Once again, thank you to the authors, translators, and editors for their hard work!	no
疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	Suspected counterfeit product, please conduct strict review, Amazon.	yes
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	The quality is extremely poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, it's even worse than roadside stall products, there is no weight, no barcode, the ten-bag packaging is also loose, it's not at all the characteristics of a qualified product; it's the worst shopping experience on Amazon, I have already applied for a return; it's completely a quality issue; I suggest the seller to open their eyes and reject inferior goods; supplement: I bought another Heart to Heart, supermarket 23 yuan/10 rolls, added a few comparison photos, further verified the inferiority of this product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic loss and further unpleasant feelings!	yes
再度期望亚马逊能够一丝不苟，严把商品源头。	Once again, there is an expectation for Amazon to be meticulous and strictly control the source of its products.	yes
马马虎虎的产品，和期望有差距	The product is mediocre and does not meet expectations.	yes
优点：	Advantages:	yes
1. 大品牌，价格便宜。	Big brand, low price.	yes
优点2：电机和刀片都是PANASONIC保证的，使用起来也还OK，但是和我期望有差距。	Advantage 2: Both the motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are okay to use, but there is a gap between the actual performance and my expectations.	yes
缺点：	Disadvantages:	yes
1. 充电没有指示灯，这个最基本你的电源指示都省下了，估计购买300元产品的客户，在松下PANASONIC的眼里，也是施舍，毫无尊重。	There is no charging indicator light, even the most basic power indicator is omitted. I guess for customers who buy a 300 yuan product, in the eyes of Panasonic, it is a handout, with no respect at all.	yes
2. 有强烈的异味 充电时候，哪怕仅仅充电10分钟，就可以闻到强烈的塑胶燃烧的那种味道。	There is a strong unpleasant smell when charging, even if it's only for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong scent of burning plastic.	yes
办公室试用了1天，搞的全屋子都是这种塑胶味道。	After a day of testing in the office, the whole room was filled with the smell of plastic.	yes
和我之前用过的同价位的飞利浦PHILIPS相比，虽然多了个刀头，但是松下这款产品，质量真是对不起消费者了。	Compared to the Philips product of the same price range that I used before, although this Panasonic product has an extra blade, the quality really lets consumers down.	yes
小包装	Small package	yes
收到快递一看上面写着电商版就知道又掉坑里了，比超市买的小了好些，应该是M，跟商品介绍上面的图片包装不一样，所谓新版吧。	Upon receiving the package and seeing "e-commerce version" written on it, I knew I had fallen into a trap again. It was much smaller than what I bought from the supermarket, probably a size M. The packaging didn't match the product description and images, probably a so-called new version.	yes
三颗星是怪自己马虎没看清楚商品规格，你卖M码电商版我没意见，你货不对版是几个意思？	Three stars is blaming myself for not carefully checking the product specifications. I have no objection to you selling M size e-commerce version, but what do you mean by delivering the wrong version?	yes
电商套路深，有时间还是去超市买了。	E-commerce can be tricky, it's better to go to the supermarket if you have time.	yes
就酱紫。	Just like that.	yes
味道不喜欢	Don't like the taste.	yes
小孩很不喜欢牙膏的味道，每次都说辣，也许用别的词形容才更贴切，小孩的词库里暂时只有这个词。	The child really dislikes the taste of toothpaste, always saying it's spicy. Perhaps a different word would be more appropriate, but for now, this is the only word in the child's vocabulary.	yes
搞活动时候买的，很便宜，所以也不好意思给差评了，四星吧，不过不会再买了。	I bought it during a promotion, it was very cheap, so I feel bad giving a bad review. Four stars, but I won't buy it again.	yes
正品哟 包装好	Authentic product, well packaged.	yes
包装很完整，里面加了充气袋，没有网上评论的只有光秃秃一个产品的样子。	The packaging was complete, with an airbag added inside, not just the bare product as some online reviews suggested.	yes
瓶子外包装上还有一层塑料膜像图片上描述的一样，快递也很快，拍下第二天就来了。	The bottle also has a layer of plastic wrap on the outside packaging as described in the picture, and the delivery was very fast, arriving the day after the order was placed.	yes
是正品，只是没货了，不知道什么时候再上架。	It is genuine, just out of stock, not sure when it will be restocked.	yes
糟心的一次购物体验	A terrible shopping experience.	yes
黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	I placed an order during Black Friday, but after waiting for a long time, I didn't receive it. Upon checking, the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues and none of them had signed for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said only the sender could initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. Finally, it was clear that the package had been mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of transfers, I finally retrieved the package. The outer packaging had been opened, but the product was still intact. I don't know if it has been used or not. It was quite a frustrating experience.	yes
错误的配图	Incorrect illustration.	yes
我以为自己能够收到图1这样的耳机，没想到却收到了图2这样的耳机，图物不一致也就算了，耳机左右声音大小不一又是什么意思？	I thought I would receive headphones like the ones in picture 1, but instead I received headphones like those in picture 2. Not only do the items not match the pictures, but what does it mean when the sound in the left and right earpieces is not the same?	yes
虽然名称都是一样的，但还是希望大家能够小心注意，另外还请亚马逊负责人及时更换正确的配图，万分感谢。	Although the names are the same, we hope everyone will be careful and we also ask the person in charge at Amazon to replace the correct pictures in a timely manner. Thank you very much.	yes
操作系统一般般	The operating system is average.	yes
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	After using it for a while, the overall display is acceptable, and there doesn't seem to be much difference. However, the system is somewhat frustrating to use, the boot time is noticeably slow, and it's not easy to set up. The pre-installed software doesn't even warrant a comment, and the response speed is just average. Compared to my colleague's, it's not even in the same league.	yes
看评论说很人性化的设计，我没有找到哪里人性化，遥控器这个常用的上下左右，返回键设计的位置实在是不敢恭维。	I read reviews saying the design is very user-friendly, but I couldn't find where it was user-friendly. The placement of the commonly used up, down, left, right, and back buttons on the remote control is really not commendable.	yes
所以呢，就当个电视吧，再外加电视盒之类的用吧。	So, just use it as a TV, and add things like a TV box.	yes
降价太厉害了	The price drop is too drastic.	yes
降价太厉害了，一百多入现在99！	The price drop is too drastic, from over a hundred to now 99!	yes
在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	I have accumulated many unreviewed orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the review content for all of them.	yes
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I use this statement to evaluate, it means that the product scores at least 85 points or above.	yes
而比较差的产品，我绝对不会偷懒到复制粘贴评价，这样其他消费者在购买的时候会作为参考，而商家也会因此改进商品质量。	For inferior products, I would never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews. This would serve as a reference for other consumers when making purchases, and the merchants would also improve the quality of their products as a result.	yes
低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	A good, affordable cable, this is enough if you're not an audiophile!	yes
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	Such a cheap cable, but it should have met the HDMI certification standards. After personal comparison, it easily beats these crappy things from Akihabara in China (the price is twice as expensive). The cable is thick and relatively soft, there is no noise in 7 meters transmission, in the future, I will only choose Beisi for low-cost cables!	yes
东西还可以，但是亚马逊的售后服务真的比其他网站差太多了	The products are okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.	yes
下单后发现下错了，但是取消订单已经取消不了，网页联系在线客服一直显示错误链接，联系不上。	After placing the order, I realized I made a mistake, but I couldn't cancel the order. The link to contact customer service on the website kept showing an error, so I couldn't get in touch.	yes
到货后送货员给我打电话，我说我不要了，想取消订单的没取消成功，派送员就拿回去了，说先给我签收上，让我申请退货。	After the delivery arrived, the courier called me. I told him I didn't want it and had tried to cancel the order unsuccessfully. The courier took it back, saying he would sign for it first and advised me to apply for a return.	yes
申请退货时才告知食品类一旦签收不能退货，没办法打电话给亚马逊客服，也是一样说法，签收不能退货。	When applying for a return, I was informed that food items cannot be returned once they have been signed for. I tried calling Amazon customer service, but they said the same thing, that items cannot be returned once they have been signed for.	yes
我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I have previously bought items that are non-refundable due to policy, including milk and diapers, from Jingdong and Suning. The customer service was able to process the returns for me, even when the diapers from Jingdong had a strong smell after opening. However, this was not possible with Amazon.	yes
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	Rules are dead, people are alive, how do your customer service handle this?	yes
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	They told me to either accept it myself or let the delivery person buy it. The delivery person already has a hard job, why should they have to pay for something they didn't purchase?	yes
行，我也不退了，我自己收下了，但是必须给你们的服务打1分	Fine, I won't return it, I'll keep it for myself, but I must give your service a score of 1.	yes
劝大家不要白花钱	I advise everyone not to waste money.	yes
首先满怀期待购买，觉得都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧，收到了以后看包装觉得还可以，个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感，吃到嘴里完全没有味道，寡淡无味，咬开来果肉一圈是暗黄色就是坏了那种，好坏参着卖的，能吃的也就不到三分之一，劝大家不要买，也不便宜，质量太差了！	I bought it with high expectations, thinking that the Doule brand wouldn't be too bad. After receiving it, I thought the packaging was okay and the size was decent. However, one box was mostly soft, which you couldn't tell from the outside, you had to feel it. It had no taste when eaten, bland and tasteless. When bitten into, the fruit flesh was a dark yellow, the kind that indicates it's spoiled. Good and bad ones were mixed together, and less than a third were edible. I advise everyone not to buy it. It's not cheap and the quality is too poor!	yes
吃一堑长一智，以后再也不在电商买水果了！	Once bitten, twice shy; I will never buy fruit from e-commerce again!	yes
产品防伪标识在哪里	Where is the product's anti-counterfeit label?	yes
瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的，从外包装袋看，感觉蹂躏的程度让人揪心，毕竟是食物类的包装太简单了，而且还是属于国际购的，还有没看到什么明显的防伪标识标志，开瓶非常轻松，关键是盖内的一层蜂蜜直接从里面冒出来了，有开口几乎是没有什么粘连性，外国产品都是这样的吗？	The bottom corner of the bottle is severely dented, which must have been caused by a strong impact. Judging from the outer packaging bag, the degree of damage is distressing, especially since it is food packaging and it is too simple, and it is also an international purchase. Moreover, there is no obvious anti-counterfeit identification mark. Opening the bottle is very easy, and the key is that a layer of honey inside the cap directly came out from inside, there is almost no adhesion when opened, is this how all foreign products are?	yes
生在中国的我有点不理解了。	As someone born in China, I'm a bit confused.	yes
应该是正品吧？	It should be genuine, right?	yes
还有拍下时提示二十几号到，这个是14号收到的，我第一次在这里海外购，只是把自己的疑惑写下来，或许这都是正常的？	Also, when I placed the order, it indicated that it would arrive in the twenties, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time shopping overseas here, I'm just writing down my doubts, maybe this is all normal?	yes
提货服务有待改进	The pick-up service needs improvement.	yes
我一共买了5份提货券，在提取时，第一次预约提取3份，结果只寄过来2份，经过多方沟通才确认是漏发、答应后需补发；第二次预约，刚好赶上休息日，网站和微信均无提示需要在工作日预约，造成了不必要的恐慌，建议以后改善。	I bought a total of 5 pick-up vouchers. When I went to pick them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 for the first time, but only 2 were sent. After multiple communications, it was confirmed that one was missed and promised to be sent later. The second appointment happened to be on a day off, and there was no prompt on the website or WeChat that an appointment needed to be made on a working day, causing unnecessary panic. I suggest improvements for the future.	yes
不错的购物	Good shopping.	yes
东西好评！	Good reviews all around!	yes
还是比较相信亚马逊自营的东西，现在海外购以后很方便，从国外买回来物流时间比国内也就多几天，不得不说亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的，比走转运要快很多，所以现在很多东西都在海外购上买。	I tend to trust products sold directly by Amazon. Now, overseas shopping is very convenient. The logistics time for buying from abroad is only a few days longer than domestic. It must be said that Amazon's ability to clear customs from overseas to domestic is very strong, much faster than transshipment, so now many things are bought on overseas shopping.	yes
希望国内商品的质量和价格能够更好一些，很多东西都是国内产的，但是出去转一圈买回来比在国内还便宜，希望改进。	I hope that the quality and price of domestic products can be improved. Many things are produced domestically, but buying them after a trip abroad is cheaper than buying them at home. I hope for improvements.	yes
垃圾	Trash	yes
看到这样的包裹，试问大家:觉不觉得是路边的垃圾?	Looking at such a package, I ask everyone: doesn't it look like roadside trash?	yes
一个塑料易碎的包装，就用一个塑料袋从所谓的德国发过来，这样的包装是负责的吗?	Is it responsible to send a fragile plastic package in a plastic bag from so-called Germany?	yes
我看这样的包装是装垃圾一样的，购买这个产品，包装及其简陋，没有任何防止破损的措施，就一个简单的塑料袋包装，到手后，包裹完全变形了，里面的物品也有破损。	I see this packaging as if it's for garbage. The product was purchased with extremely shoddy packaging, with no measures to prevent damage. It was simply wrapped in a plastic bag. Upon receipt, the package was completely deformed and the items inside were damaged.	yes
如果我只是碰到一个这样的，我认了，买了几个都是这样子，找亚马逊客服，客服就说可以退，但运费垫付，然后运费以礼品卡的形式返回给我。	If I had just encountered one like this, I would have accepted it, but I bought several like this. I contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I could return it, but I had to pay for the shipping upfront, and then the shipping cost would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.	yes
我试问一下，我用现金支付运费，你们给我返礼品卡，这是要我自己买你们礼品卡就直说啊，还要自己把产品邮寄到德国仓库，这不是买个产品受罪啊!	I have a question, if I pay the shipping fee in cash, and you give me a gift card in return, are you asking me to buy your gift cards? And I have to send the product to the warehouse in Germany myself, isn't this making purchasing a product a hassle!	yes
而我一直跟客服说，出现这样的问题是谁的责任，客服却半句不说是他们的责任，连半句责任都不敢担当，这样的售后服务还有什么保障呢? 一句话:认栽!但我估计我这个评价，亚马逊都不会给公布的机会，直接回删除!	I kept asking the customer service who was responsible for this issue, but they didn't admit it was their fault, not even a word of responsibility. What kind of guarantee does such after-sales service provide? In one word: admit defeat! But I guess Amazon won't even give me the chance to publish this review, they'll just delete it!	yes
质量很好5星，物流很差	The quality is very good, 5 stars, but the logistics are very poor.	yes
1，质量很好，秒杀的，价格适中，物超所值。	The quality is very good, it's a steal, the price is reasonable, and it's worth more than it costs.	yes
2，结实、用料足、焊点牢固、表面处理得当、颜色很好。	The product is sturdy, made with sufficient materials, has solid welding points, appropriate surface treatment, and good color.	yes
3，物流是硬伤，3号下的单，11号到的。	The logistics are a major issue; orders placed on the 3rd arrived on the 11th.	yes
4，如果亚马逊没有标注预计到货时间是2月7号，我或许会很满意。	I might have been very satisfied if Amazon hadn't marked the estimated arrival date as February 7th.	yes
5，但标注了预期到货时间，就相当于给用户一个承诺，当承诺无法兑现的时候，用户很难受。	However, marking an expected arrival time is like making a promise to the user, and it's hard for the user to accept when that promise can't be fulfilled.	yes
6，如果你没有给予承诺的把握，请不要做出承诺。	If you are not sure you can keep a promise, please do not make one.	yes
7，实际上，我非常在意商家做出的承诺。	In fact, I care very much about the promises made by businesses.	yes
8，所以，我打了低分。	So, I gave it a low score.	yes
金线会掉色	The gold thread will fade in color.	yes
效果还是有的，但感觉是否明显，就看个人咯，或是心理作用。	The effects are there, but whether they are noticeable depends on the individual, or it could be a placebo effect.	yes
有一点不太好的，就是金色的线，本来设计出来是觉得好看，但实际上，这个金线会掉色，往车上一放，如果拿动几次，手上，和车上，会有一些金粉。	One downside is the golden thread, which was originally designed for aesthetics, but in reality, this gold thread fades. If it is placed in the car and moved a few times, there will be some gold dust on the hands and in the car.	yes
希望产品可以改进。	The product is hoped to be improved.	yes
这种方形的，也没啥装饰效果，就不要搞金线上去，掉下来在车上弄脏车还麻烦。	This square one, which doesn't have much decorative effect, shouldn't have gold lines added to it. If they fall off and dirty the car, it would be troublesome.	yes
东西完好，速度可以，分2个包裹还不同包装	The items are intact, the speed is acceptable, and they are divided into two packages with different packaging.	yes
8天的速度蛮快的，但就是2件分了2个包裹，包装还不一样，明显一个防震太多了，厚纸板贴着，封了层塑料，外包装也方便拆，一个就国内的快递盒似的，放了几个缓冲气囊就算事了，感觉有点敷衍。	The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but the two items were split into two packages, and the packaging was not the same. One was obviously over-protected, with thick cardboard attached and a layer of plastic sealed, and the outer packaging was also easy to unpack. The other one was like a domestic express box, with a few air cushions considered done, which felt a bit perfunctory.	yes
雅兰床垫真心不错	The Eran mattress is genuinely good.	yes
34CM的床垫不是一般的厚，不要床直接睡床垫都可以了。	A 34cm mattress is not typically thick, you could even sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.	yes
质量很好，不管是正面还是背面，都挺软的，睡眠很舒服，躺在上面很快就睡着了。	The quality is very good, both the front and the back are quite soft, sleeping is very comfortable, and you fall asleep quickly when lying on it.	yes
床垫收到后因为快递暴力运输有两处有些污渍，雅兰客服很负责，很有效率的联系解决了问题。	Upon receiving the mattress, there were two stains due to rough handling during delivery. The Yalan customer service was very responsible and efficiently resolved the issue.	yes
并不是自营商品，亚马逊无耻了	It's not a self-operated product, Amazon is shameless.	yes
页面明确标注自营，实际上由供应商配送，售后由供应商负责，出问题自行联系供货商。	The page clearly indicates that it is self-operated, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier, the after-sales service is the responsibility of the supplier, and if there are any problems, you need to contact the supplier directly.	yes
想取消订单，对不起，订单信息已传递给供应商，不能取消；想退换货，在亚马逊成功申请了退换货，对不起，没有人理你，需要自行联系供货商退货。	If you want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has already been passed to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; if you want to return or exchange goods, even if you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon, sorry, no one will pay attention to you, you need to contact the supplier for returns yourself.	yes
这尼玛哪门子自营商品。	What the hell kind of self-operated merchandise is this?	yes
商品不是亚马逊配送，售后亚马逊不承担，客服竟然说“我帮你联系供应商”，还声称就是自营，太无耻了，赤裸裸的不要脸，赤裸裸的对消费者进行欺诈！	The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not take responsibility for after-sales service. The customer service even said "I will help you contact the supplier," and claimed that it is self-operated. This is too shameless, blatantly faceless, and blatantly defrauding consumers!	yes
郁闷的体验	The experience of depression.	yes
之前在别家网购的滤芯，过滤效果不错，28天结束之后再用多一两天也一样没有水垢。	The filter cartridge I previously bought online from another store had a good filtering effect, and even after 28 days, there was no scale even if it was used for an extra day or two.	yes
由于一直以来在亚马逊购置的东西品质都可以，这次就想着在这边买，第一次在亚马逊买滤芯，感觉不太好，不但早早就开始有水垢，而且滤芯一直用到第28天，都会有悬浮的小黑碳粉，真不知道是继续用下去，还是直接扔了好，非常郁闷~	Having always been satisfied with the quality of items purchased from Amazon, I decided to buy a filter cartridge there for the first time. However, the experience was not very good. Not only did limescale start to appear early on, but small black carbon particles were still suspended in the water on the 28th day of using the filter cartridge. I really don't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. It's very frustrating.	yes
没有想象的那么好	It's not as good as imagined.	yes
和我以往用过的插线板比较，外部做工一般，内部如何未拆开看，但愿如店家所描述，从使用方便性上看，每一独立单位是否通电缺少显示	Compared to the power strips I've used in the past, the external workmanship is average, I haven't opened it to see the inside, but I hope it's as the seller described. From the perspective of ease of use, there is a lack of display to show whether each independent unit is powered.	yes
包装破损了，等时间来检验产品的质量。	The packaging is damaged, we will have to wait for time to test the quality of the product.	yes
外包装破损较严重，里面的包装盒似乎是新的，但是说明书好像不是新的，九月才装修，囤货中，希望到时候不会是坏的，请亚马逊解释一下为什么好几个顾客提到包装破损，你们却能安然处之，谢谢！	The outer packaging is severely damaged, the inner box seems to be new, but the instruction manual doesn't seem to be new. I just renovated in September and am stocking up, I hope it won't be broken by then. Amazon, please explain why several customers mentioned damaged packaging, yet you seem to be okay with it. Thank you!	yes
总体不错，有点小问题	Overall good, with a few minor issues.	yes
第一次购买滤水壶，看了几篇评价文章，感觉LAICA的性价比高些就选择了这个，收到货按说明书装好了滤芯，试用了一下，感觉总体不错，但是在倒水的时候好像原水会从壶嘴的地方与处理后的水混合（原水仓密封不太严）。	This was my first time buying a water filter jug. After reading several reviews, I felt that LAICA offered better value for money, so I chose this one. After receiving the product and installing the filter according to the instructions, I found it generally satisfactory. However, it seems that the unfiltered water might mix with the filtered water when pouring, as the seal on the raw water compartment doesn't seem very tight.	yes
用的时候一定要等所有水过滤完再倒出！	When using, make sure all the water is filtered before pouring it out!	yes
图片不完整	The image is incomplete.	yes
图片没有拍出侧面的细节，侧面的细节跟主体的风格并不一致，有很大差别，这是其一；这个珠子是泰国产的，没有标明产地，这是其二；没有标明质地，这是其三；我在英国买的时候，分明每项各有盒子，这里只有一个简简单单的塑料袋，而且珠子上面没有任何的产品标志，我哪里判断得出是真是假。	The photo did not capture the details of the side, which are not consistent with the main style and differ greatly, that's one; the bead is produced in Thailand, but the place of origin is not marked, that's two; the texture is not marked, that's three; when I bought it in the UK, each item had its own box, but here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product logo on the bead, how can I judge whether it is real or fake.	yes
购买要慎重哦，尤其是买香港出来的东西。	Be careful when making purchases, especially when buying items from Hong Kong.	yes
亚马逊客服真烂	Amazon's customer service is really terrible.	yes
两天前下的订单，今天收到就发现降了40块钱，花了好多时间找到客服，客服说没法补差价，可以重买并退货。	I placed an order two days ago and found out today that the price had dropped by 40 yuan. I spent a lot of time contacting customer service, who said they couldn't refund the difference, but I could repurchase and return the original item.	yes
这种客户体验和服务比某宝某东真是差一万倍。	This customer experience and service is ten thousand times worse than that of certain online shopping platforms.	yes
还行，作为新手来说，值得入手	Not bad, worth getting for a beginner.	yes
品相过得去，和极品金刚没得比，之前看过商场那个价格，少说都好几百，我是第一次玩金刚，还行。	The quality is passable, but it can't compare to the top-notch Transformers. I've seen the price in the mall before, it's at least several hundred. This is my first time playing with Transformers, it's okay.	yes
东西不错	The stuff is not bad.	yes
东西着实不错，送女友的，只是中午我不在加拿快递的时候有些不愉快，物流公司直接放邮件寄存宝里并且没发取件的验证短信给我，害我跑了两趟。	The product is really good, a gift for my girlfriend, but I had some unpleasant experience with the delivery at noon when I was not in Canada. The logistics company directly put it in the mail storage box and did not send me a verification message for pick-up, causing me to make two trips.	yes
不过宝贝确实不错。	But the baby is indeed good.	yes
值得购买	Worth buying.	yes
小猴子可爱，亚马逊优惠力度真大，周生生官网直接发货，前天晚上下单，今天下午就收到了，真快。	The little monkey is cute, Amazon offers great discounts, Chow Sang Sang's official website ships directly. I placed an order the night before yesterday and received it this afternoon. That's really fast.	yes
邮政快递员也很负责。	The postal courier is also very responsible.	yes

1 收到这样残次品，亚马逊客服告诉你不要急啊，我们54小时左右会跟你联系。	Upon receiving such a defective product, Amazon customer service told you not to worry, they would contact you in about 54 hours.	yes
2 然后中间你联系客服人员，他们会告诉你这个问题会有专员处理，他会告知你结果。	Then you contact the customer service staff in the middle, they will tell you that a specialist will handle this issue and inform you of the result.	yes
你永远主动联系不上这个专员，也不知道她的工号，也没有直线联系电话，就是你联系不上她，只有她联系你。	You can never actively contact this officer, nor do you know her employee number, nor do you have a direct contact number. You simply cannot reach her; she can only contact you.	yes
3悲剧的是等了近3天，这个专员联系了我，我手机离开了一会，没有接到这个专员的电话。	Sadly, after waiting for nearly three days, the representative contacted me, but I missed the call as I was away from my phone for a while.	yes
我等了2个小时也没有等来那个专员的电话，期间我主动联系了亚马逊客服，并邮件发送了客服让她给我回电话。	I waited for 2 hours but did not receive a call from the commissioner. During this time, I proactively contacted Amazon customer service and sent an email asking them to call me back.	yes
4近3天过去了我都还不知道亚马逊对我收到这个残次品的咖啡机，会有什么处理结果！	Nearly three days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon's response will be to the defective coffee machine I received!	yes
5美国亚马逊的商品没有问题，海外购这种购物方式是好的，但是比对美亚的服务可就差远了。	The products from Amazon US are fine, overseas shopping is a good method, but the service is far inferior compared to Amazon US.	yes
6对我来说我只能继续等待...	For me, all I can do is continue to wait...	yes
底不平	Uneven bottom.	yes
因为看点评里说的都很好，所有对这款锅很有期待，拿到手的时候也很喜欢，很轻巧，但开锅的时候就发现问题了，锅底不是平的，中间突起来，周边凹下去，油都跑到周边了，特意买来的开锅大肥肉炸出好多油都没法覆盖中央区域，糊了，开锅都开不了，这样的构造估计没法正常煮菜。	Because the reviews were all very good, I had high expectations for this pot. I was very pleased when I received it because it was lightweight. However, I encountered a problem when I started to use it. The bottom of the pot is not flat, it bulges in the middle and dips around the edges, causing all the oil to run to the sides. The large piece of fatty meat I specifically bought to season the pot produced a lot of oil, but it couldn't cover the central area and got burnt. I couldn't even season the pot properly, and I doubt I can cook normally with this design.	yes
不知道是否我运气不好，刚好拿到个底子不平的锅，幸亏亚马逊提供一个月的退货服务，果断退了。	I don't know if I was just unlucky, but I happened to get a pan with an uneven base. Thankfully, Amazon offers a one-month return service, so I promptly returned it.	yes
我把锅刷得干干净净地退了，白忙活了半天。	I scrubbed the pot clean and returned it, having wasted half a day for nothing.	yes

这是一款设计风格非常简洁的产品。	This is a product with a very simple design style.	yes
立方体的造型，设计师把顶部处理成微微的弧面。	The cube shape, the designer treated the top into a slight curve.	yes
本来应该是非常流畅的线条。	The lines should have been very smooth.	yes
可惜最终效果没有能够实现。	Unfortunately, the final result could not be achieved.	yes
因为顶部有两个部件，前面是控制面板，后面水盒顶盖。	Because there are two components at the top, the front is the control panel and the back is the water tank cover.	yes
顶盖的弧度和控制面板的弧度居然不一致，拼合之后出现了一个最高2mm左右的高差。	The curvature of the top cover and the control panel were not consistent, resulting in a height difference of about 2mm after assembly.	yes
虽然看起来是一个很小的缝隙。	Although it appears to be a small gap.	yes
但是可以说是把整个设计感都摧毁了。	But it can be said that it destroyed the entire sense of design.	yes
有点心疼那个产品设计师。	I feel a bit sorry for that product designer.	yes
看来美的的产品经理还没有能力去打造这样的水准的产品。	It seems that Midea's product manager does not yet have the ability to create a product of this standard.	no
（对于售后小姐的回馈当然不能要求太高，但当我听到售后说道这款产品所有的个体都是这样的，不是只有我买的这件有问题时，她的不以为然和如实重负的情绪让我明白对美的也不能要求太高） 2019-7-7水泵故障出水量少，已经第二次维修，第一次维修后两周又坏了。	(Of course, one cannot expect too much from the feedback of the after-sales lady, but when I heard her say that all units of this product are like this, not just the one I bought, her indifference and heavy burden of truth made me realize that I can't expect too much from beauty either) On July 7, 2019, the pump failed and the water output was low, it was the second repair, and it broke again two weeks after the first repair.	no
优惠后很划算，亚马逊假优惠很伤心	It's a great deal after the discount, but Amazon's fake discounts are very disappointing.	yes
宝宝出生一周购买，保温超强。	Purchased one week after the baby's birth, it has excellent insulation.	yes
壶的外面摸不到一丝热量，即不怕烫到人也能有效保护温度不外散。	The outside of the pot does not feel hot to the touch, ensuring it won't burn anyone and effectively preventing heat from escaping.	yes
经过一个晚上空调房依然能保持很高的温度。	After a night, the air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature.	yes
亚马逊说周年活动320大优惠，后来发现大家249,289,299都有，瞬间有种被欺骗感，但是去超市对比了一下依然比同价位各种杂牌划算多了，今后外出可随车携带。	Amazon claimed a big discount for their anniversary event at 320, but later everyone found out that there were also discounts at 249, 289, and 299, which instantly gave a feeling of being deceived. However, after comparing with the supermarket, it was still much more cost-effective than various off-brands at the same price. It can be carried with the car when going out in the future.	yes
Vitamix 维他美仕6300	Vitamix 6300	yes
已观望很久，看到美亚6300打折，中亚海外购同价，赶紧下手。	After waiting for a long time, I saw that the price of the product on Amazon was reduced to 6300, and the same price was offered on Amazon's overseas purchase, so I quickly made a purchase.	yes

包装箱不大，直接用的是Vitamix 的原包装，亚马逊也不怕漂洋过海的摔坏了！	The packaging box is not big, it directly uses Vitamix's original packaging, Amazon is not afraid of it being damaged across the ocean!	yes
机器看着挺新，配件齐全，就是杯子放在底座上晃动的厉害，我都害怕开机杯子直接飞出去！	The machine looks quite new and comes with all the accessories, but the cup shakes terribly when placed on the base. I'm afraid to turn it on in case the cup flies off!	yes
问了一个有5200的朋友，听他描述好像没有我的这个这么松。	I asked a friend who has 5200 friends, and from his description, it seems like mine is not as loose as his.	yes
随机附带的食谱全英文，看得挺累，网上也没找到中文版，这是个麻烦事！	The randomly included recipes are all in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I couldn't find a Chinese version online, which is a hassle!	yes
收到货后赶紧的买个了变压器，估计3天能到吧，到时候再好好折腾！	After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer. I guess it will arrive in about 3 days, and then I can tinker with it properly!	yes
太小，没伞套，材质一般。	It's too small, doesn't have an umbrella cover, and the material is average.	yes
根本不是大号！	It's not a large size at all!	yes
第二把Totes，1.这把没有伞套 2.伞柄材质一般 3.明明写Large,实际上就是一人用的便捷雨伞,两个人用估计够呛。	The second Totes umbrella, 1. This one doesn't come with a cover 2. The handle material is average 3. Despite being labeled as Large, it's actually a convenient umbrella for one person, it would probably be a squeeze for two people.	yes
反而之前在美亚买的那把能三个人用无压力。	On the contrary, the one previously bought from Amazon can be used by three people without any pressure.	yes
感觉不太好	I'm not feeling very well.	yes
首先是箱子并不怎么结实，用加按一下就变形了，其次是背面设计的平放时防止箱面的ABS刮花并起不了作用，再次是箱子里面就是一块布包着、拉杆的地方凸显出来..等等，各种不满意，最后拉链有点不顺畅。	Firstly, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms with a little pressure, secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS surface of the box from being scratched when placed flat, thirdly, inside the box is just a piece of cloth wrapped around, the place where the pull rod protrudes... and so on, all kinds of dissatisfaction, finally, the zipper is a bit unsmooth.	yes
PS：轮子感觉确实挺好的	PS: The wheels do indeed feel quite good.	yes
还可以	It's okay.	yes
优点：这款双肩包比较精致，看起来耐用。	Advantage: This backpack is quite delicate and appears to be durable.	yes
缺点：卡片上的二维码扫不到（搞什么鬼），15.6寸的笔记本放不下（再长一点点行不行），这款双肩包拉链可以锁起来，却不为买家准备一把锁，不可谓服务至上。	Disadvantages: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what's going on?), a 15.6-inch laptop does not fit (can it be a bit longer?), this backpack's zipper can be locked, but no lock is provided for the buyer, which can hardly be called top-notch service.	yes
整体还行，不认识是否是真皮	Overall it's okay, not sure if it's real leather.	yes
整体感觉还行，不认识是否是真皮，也就不能瞎评价了。	Overall, it feels okay, I can't tell if it's real leather, so I can't make a blind judgement.	yes

标签粘性太差，不防水	The label adhesive is too weak and not waterproof.	yes
虽然蓝牙连接很方便，但是打印出来的内容不防水，而且表面没有覆膜；且标签粘性很差，用于线缆标签根本不行，非常容易掉下来，买来用于整理线缆的朋友需要注意一下了。	Although Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not laminated; moreover, the label's adhesion is poor, making it unsuitable for cable labels as they can easily fall off. Friends who buy it for cable management need to be aware of this.	yes
笔还可以，不过包裹太简陋了，就一个纸盒子，什么保护措施都没有，而且装笔的盒子用一大块透明胶粘着，撕下来胶都在盒子上。	The pen is fine, but the packaging was too simple, just a cardboard box, with no protective measures. Moreover, the box for the pen was stuck with a large piece of transparent tape, and when torn off, the glue remained on the box.	yes

先赞一下天天快递吧，航空件，超迅速，服务态度也很好！	Let's first praise Tiantian Express, their air freight is super fast and their service attitude is also very good!	yes
一直在用925-25,非常棒，刚收到925-85，笔的质量没的说，样式也非常漂亮，之所以给四星是因为笔有点重，不适合快速写字，笔帽调节铅芯长度处有点晃动，个人意见：925-25要比85更顺手。	I've been using the 925-25, which is great. I just received the 925-85, the quality of the pen is unquestionable and the style is very beautiful. The reason I gave it four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, and the cap adjustment for the lead length is a bit shaky. Personal opinion: the 925-25 is more handy than the 85.	yes
因此变成亚马逊死忠粉	Therefore, became a die-hard fan of Amazon.	yes

这耳机是真垃圾，我不知道是我的耳朵出问题了，还是这个耳机确实不如从前了。	These headphones are really terrible, I don't know if it's my ears that have a problem or if these headphones are indeed not as good as they used to be.	yes
我两年前在某易购买过一个蓝色的，音质还不错没有杂音低音也不错，用了两年多用坏了打算再买一个（urbeats ），毕竟感觉还不错。	I bought a blue one from a certain easy purchase two years ago, the sound quality was pretty good with no noise and decent bass. After using it for more than two years and it broke, I plan to buy another one (urbeats), as I feel it was quite good.	yes

开始我以为是那首歌音效的缘故没有多想，可后来听了半天我才发现这个问题很严重，不光偏音，低音效果也没我之前那个听起来好了，还有些许杂音，是只有我买的这个紫色的有这个现象吗？还是现在耳机制造工艺确实不行了呢?	At first, I thought it was due to the sound effects of the song and didn't think much of it, but after listening for a while, I realized that the problem was serious. Not only was the sound off, but the bass effect was not as good as before, and there was some noise. Is it just the purple one I bought that has this problem?

感觉索尼要放在中国代工要比小马好多了。	It feels like Sony's decision to outsource in China is much better than Pony's.	yes
5.机器发热大，看场电影用的两声道2个小时左右顶盖用手摸一下得有40-50℃，不知道是不是变压器太大发热量大。	The machine heats up significantly, after about two hours of watching a movie with two channels, the top cover feels about 40-50℃ to the touch. I'm not sure if it's because the transformer is too big and generates a lot of heat.	yes
现在多用开关电源，这个傻大的变压器估计得有4KG。	Nowadays, switch power supplies are commonly used, and this big, dumb transformer probably weighs about 4KG.	no
索尼应该在机器里面用主动散热的静音风扇，开箱后只看到管子上大型铝板散热片。	Sony should have used an active cooling silent fan inside the machine, but upon opening the box, only a large aluminum heat sink on the pipe was seen.	no

于是发邮件给卖家问是否能提供快递单号，过了两天一直没有回复。	So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide a tracking number, but there was no response after two days.	yes

货还不错	The goods are not bad.	yes
首先说一句刚买了几天就发现降价了，差评，本还算不错，性价比高，cpu和显卡足够应付主流网游和相当一部分大型单机了，散热非常好，但屏幕有点漏光(ips屏的通病)，音响质量不太好，硬盘不好(建议自己花点钱加个固态)，昨天拿去售后检测了一下硬件，没有任何问题，自带的win8.1不太好用，建议升级成10，卖家发货很快，各项询问回答的也很快，收到电脑第二天发票就到了，不错，可惜什么赠品都没有。	Firstly, I just bought it a few days ago and found out it had been reduced in price, which is disappointing. The laptop itself is quite good, with high cost performance. The CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable part of large single-player games. The cooling is very good, but the screen has a bit of light leakage (a common problem with IPS screens). The sound quality is not very good, and the hard drive is not good (I suggest spending some money to add a solid state drive). I took it to after-sales for a hardware check yesterday, and there were no problems. The pre-installed Windows 8.1 is not very user-friendly, I suggest upgrading to Windows 10. The seller shipped quickly and answered all inquiries quickly. The invoice arrived the day after I received the computer, which is good, but unfortunately there were no gifts.	yes
(顺便提一句买键盘贴膜一定不要去某宝一家叫E酷数码中心的店买，发货慢质量差，产品有问题不退不换，老板还满嘴脏话，特别曝光一下)	(By the way, when buying keyboard film, definitely do not go to a Taobao store called E Cool Digital Center. The delivery is slow, the quality is poor, and they do not accept returns or exchanges for faulty products. The owner also uses foul language. Just a special mention.)	yes
东西很好，平台官僚依旧	The goods are excellent, but the platform bureaucracy remains.	yes
硬盘质量非常好，性价比绝对高，比香港买还便宜，不急着用和可以忍受物流的话绝对推荐购买。	The hard drive is of excellent quality and absolutely high cost-performance ratio, even cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the logistics, I would definitely recommend purchasing it.	yes
但不得不说的是亚马逊平台之官僚依旧，与几年前我发誓绝对不用的时候没有改进，你永远查不到实际物流状况，信息永远是几个星期以后送到，永远不能投诉，就是这么官僚！	However, it must be said that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform remains unchanged from a few years ago when I swore I would never use it again. You can never check the actual logistics status, the information is always delivered a few weeks later, you can never complain, it's just so bureaucratic!	yes
货收到几天了，物流信息还是10几天后你将会收到货！	The goods have been received for a few days, but the logistics information still says you will receive the goods in about ten days!	yes
物流不省心	Logistics is a headache.	yes
送来成这个样子，不仅包装压扁，电器包装也是开的，也不知道有没有调包。	It arrived in this condition, not only was the packaging crushed, the appliance packaging was also open, I don't even know if anything was switched.	yes
FYI	For Your Information.	yes
还没有试用，一贯信赖飞利浦，希望电池寿命比其它牌子要长一些。	I haven't tried it yet, but I always trust Philips and hope that the battery life is longer than other brands.	yes
上网查了，可能是进水的通病，而且没有保修。	I looked it up online, it might be a common problem with water ingress, and there's no warranty.	yes
郁闷！	Depressed!	yes
现在裹上保鲜膜继续用，不知能用多久？	Now that it's wrapped in cling film and continues to be used, I wonder how long it can last?	yes
买到别人拆开过的	Bought something that has been opened by someone else.	yes
三百多的机器要一百多的税确实比较高，看现在再六百多心里平衡多了。	The tax of over a hundred on more than three hundred machines is indeed high, but seeing it now at over six hundred makes me feel much more balanced.	yes
收到的时候封口胶条状态看着就很不对，像是拆开过，赶紧先拍了照，果然一撕就开了，打开后里面的纸板还有损坏，担心是别人退的，还没到纪念日就赶紧先给老公试试了，结果机器一点电都没有，还好刀头里面没有胡渣，要不大老远的咋退啊！	When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape looked very wrong, as if it had been opened. I quickly took a picture, and sure enough, it opened as soon as I tore it. After opening it, the cardboard inside was also damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I hurriedly tried it on my husband before the anniversary. As a result, the machine had no power at all, but luckily there were no stubble in the blade, otherwise how would I return it from such a distance!	yes
好不好用或者短期会不会有什么问题还未知，如前面的评价，缺货时发出的东西确实不靠谱！	Whether it's good to use or if there will be any short-term problems is still unknown, as the previous review stated, the items sent out when out of stock are indeed unreliable!	yes
体验感中偏上水平	Above average in terms of experience.	yes
差不多顶级电动了，有很多种洁牙模式，但是很少人会天天换不同模式刷吧。	It's almost top-of-the-line electric, with many different tooth cleaning modes, but few people would change modes every day.	yes
用了半年没有啥问题，每天刷，差不多1个多星期一冲。	I've been using it for half a year without any problems, brushing every day, and it needs to be charged about once a week.	yes
刷头配件在亚马逊买同样便宜。	The brush head attachments are just as cheap on Amazon.	yes
App有点难用，除了改一下颜色那些，其他貌似兼容的问题是海外版的原因？	The app is a bit difficult to use, apart from changing the colors and such, it seems that other compatibility issues are due to the overseas version?	yes
希望学学大法的。	I want to learn the Great Law.	yes
性价比很高	High cost-performance ratio.	yes

2、使用非常简单，清洗也很方便。	It is very easy to use and also convenient to clean.	yes
3、完全可以DIY理发，省钱了。	You can totally DIY your haircut and save money.	yes
综上，非常成功的一次购买。	In conclusion, it was a very successful purchase.	yes
有假货	There are counterfeits.	yes
上次买了两包，居然是两种不同的版本，本来包装上左下角的字是绿色的，结果有一包就不是，是白色的字，结果猫猫吃了就拉肚子了。	Last time I bought two packs, they turned out to be two different versions. Originally, the words in the lower left corner of the package were green, but one pack was not, it had white words. As a result, the cat had diarrhea after eating it.	yes
是亚马逊的货源是假的，还是发货时被员工掉包，我确定不了。	I can't confirm whether the goods from Amazon are fake, or if they were switched by the staff during delivery.	yes
我会再买一次，如果还是假货，我就要找你们相关人士追责了。	I will buy it again, and if it's still counterfeit, I will hold your relevant personnel accountable.	yes
是横杠的！	It's a hyphen!	yes
亚马逊图片上是斜杠的，结果给我发来是横杠的，这不是骗人吗?	The picture on Amazon showed a slash, but what they sent me was a dash, isn't this a scam?	yes
效果还行	The effect is okay.	yes
猫猫喜欢吃，这是重点。	The cat likes to eat, that's the point.	yes
也确实有效果。	Indeed, it is effective.	yes
紧、窄，箍脚、磨脚背。	Tight, narrow, binding feet, rubbing the top of the foot.	yes
不推荐。	Not recommended.	yes
1.UN是clarks最舒服的系列，可惜这款太差了。	UN is the most comfortable series from Clarks, but unfortunately, this model is too poor.	yes
追加：今天对比了以前的UN系列鞋垫（鞋扔了垫留着用），材质比以前差了不少，弹性不如以前，透气也不如以前，就是假假的软。	Addendum: Today I compared the insoles of the previous UN series shoes (the shoes were thrown away but the insoles were kept for use), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it's just falsely soft.	yes
2.我的脚背不算高，硌的部位在脚背最高处向前3公分左右。	The arch of my foot is not very high, and the part that gets rubbed is about 3 centimeters forward from the highest point of the arch.	yes
3.海外购买了三双clarks，只有一双合适。	I bought three pairs of Clarks from overseas, but only one pair fits.	yes
吓得我把收藏夹里的其乐都删了。	I was so scared that I deleted all the games from my favorites.	yes
回头试试rockport，不行只能去ecco实体店了。	Try Rockport again, if it doesn't work, the only option is to go to the ECCO physical store.	yes
以次充好，品控不好	Subpar filling, poor quality control.	yes
首先，值得肯定的是Prime海外购Ups很给力，31号下的单6号就收到了。	Firstly, it's worth acknowledging that Prime's overseas purchase Ups is very efficient, orders placed on the 31st were received by the 6th.	yes
鞋子颜色比图片好看很多，皮质感觉不错。	The color of the shoes is much better than in the picture, and the leather feels good.	yes
鞋码稍大一点点，25脚长10.5宽拍的7.5W，上脚稍微有点宽松，不过平时就喜欢穿宽松一点，垫一双鞋垫刚好。	The shoe size is a bit larger, with a foot length of 25 and a width of 10.5, the 7.5W is a bit loose when worn, but I usually like to wear it a bit loose, and it fits just right with a pair of insoles.	yes
其次，这个鞋子品控真的不敢恭维，一只鞋底胶有破损，另外一只鞋面有各种擦痕还有个针眼，鞋面与鞋底连接处胶条错位，明摆着的以次充好！	Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not flattering. One shoe has a damaged sole, the other has various scratches and a pinhole on the surface, and the glue strip at the connection between the shoe surface and the sole is misplaced. It's clearly a case of substituting inferior products for good ones!	yes
有点后悔！	A bit of regret!	yes
做活动280块买到的，这个价格买到亚瑟士相当划算，当然看评论还有更低的价格。	I bought it for 280 yuan during a promotion, which is quite a good deal for Asics. Of course, according to the reviews, there are even lower prices.	yes
现在说一下鞋子，优点：鞋子很轻，跑步挺舒服，也比较合脚，不会松松垮垮的。	Now about the shoes, the advantages: the shoes are very light, comfortable for running, and fit well, they are not loose.	yes
颜值很高但缺点也很明显：我一般穿40的鞋，这次买的40.5的，穿进去鞋子前端大概还有1个大拇指的距离，但是，这并不影响什么。	The shoes are very attractive but the drawbacks are also obvious: I usually wear size 40, but this time I bought 40.5, and there is about a thumb's width of space at the front of the shoe. However, this does not affect anything.	yes
这鞋很“窄”，虽然前面还留着距离，但是感觉紧紧的。	The shoe is very "narrow," although there is still space in the front, it feels tight.	yes
还有一点，鞋子透气可能不太好，现在穿感觉脚很热。	Another point is that the shoes may not be very breathable, as my feet feel very hot when wearing them now.	yes
压脚背	Pressing the top of the foot.	yes
首先鞋子做工很好，值这个价。	Firstly, the shoes are well made and worth the price.	yes
我的脚是很标准那种，跑鞋uk7.5,eu41.5,皮鞋uk6.5,亚马逊的爱步也买过几双，从来没有出现过不合脚，但是这双我参照评论，买大一号uk7,上脚后因为大了一码长度明显偏长，但因为鞋垫太厚，还是压脚背压的厉害，加上徒步鞋非常硬，导致上脚非常难受。	My feet are quite standard, with running shoes at UK7.5, EU41.5, and leather shoes at UK6.5. I've bought several pairs from Amazon's Aibu, and they've always fit well. However, for this pair, I bought a size larger (UK7) based on the reviews. The shoes were noticeably too long because they were a size too big, but because the insoles were too thick, they still pressed hard on the top of my foot. Combined with the hardness of the walking shoes, they were very uncomfortable to wear.	yes
如果你的脚不是特别瘦那种，不推荐购买这款。	If your feet are not particularly slim, this model is not recommended.	yes
如果一定要买，换个鞋垫也能解决，但是原配鞋垫看起来很高级的样子，不用又可惜。	If you must buy, changing the insole can solve the problem, but the original insole looks very high-end, it's a pity not to use it.	yes
非常完美的一次购物！	A perfect shopping experience!	yes
非常满意，非常喜欢，亚马逊海外购都是正品毋庸置疑，质量也非常好，物美价廉，买的放心，售后服务很周到，客服态度都很亲切和蔼，处理问题耐心高效，完美解决后顾之忧，配套的快递送货上门非常便捷稳妥，送货师傅很替顾客着想，每次都会提醒及时从快递柜中取货，感谢亚马逊给顾客提供如此舒适的购物体验。	Very satisfied, very fond of, Amazon overseas purchases are undoubtedly genuine, the quality is also very good, good value for money, rest assured to buy, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very kind and amiable, dealing with problems patiently and efficiently, perfectly solving the worries, the matching express delivery to the door is very convenient and reliable, the delivery master is very considerate for customers, will always remind to pick up from the express cabinet in time, thank Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.	yes

再说一下包装，就是用保鲜膜包了几层，里面连个包装塑料泡泡纸都没有，打开一看，所有的零件就放在空荡荡的盒子里，还好玩具质量不错，没有坏掉的零件，就是比想象中的小太多了，因为不是带电池的，手推着经常脱轨，感觉轨道两边空隙太大，设计不合理。	Regarding the packaging, it was wrapped in several layers of cling film, without even a bubble wrap inside. Upon opening, all the parts were just placed in an empty box. Thankfully, the quality of the toy was good and there were no broken parts, but it was much smaller than imagined.

我联系厂家问手表在入库有核对时间吗?他们回复说“有”，既然有，那为啥时间相差那么多，那肯定是手表没有精确度，简单地说就是水货产品，不是我说的难听，看嘛，很明显的质量问题（数字显示不完全）都拿出来卖，是不是垃圾货。	I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watch was time-checked upon storage. They replied "yes." If so, why is there such a big time difference? It must be that the watch is not accurate, simply put, it's a grey market product. I don't mean to be rude, but look, they are selling it with obvious quality issues (incomplete digital display). Isn't it junk?	yes

很满意的手表	A very satisfactory watch.	yes
肯定是正品，去专柜验过货，表的外观很漂亮，做工精细，用料足，加上又是进口机械机芯，所以是有一定的分量的，是那些三四百所谓的机械表不能比的，这个是货真价实的。	It's definitely genuine, I've had it checked at the counter. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the materials are sufficient, and it has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It's incomparable to those so-called mechanical watches that cost three or four hundred. This one is truly worth its price.	yes
表的走时是很准的，误差完全在可接受范围内，表的包装里有珠宝鉴定证书，表盘的12字那里是真钻石，这个自己戴很合适，作为礼品送出去也很有面子。	The watch keeps time very accurately, with errors well within the acceptable range.

It was in stock but not sold directly by Amazon and there was no price increase (which made me secretly happy). However, because it was not sold directly by Amazon, the delivery was slower, and the system showed that the latest expected delivery date would be September 27th.	yes
老婆没手机用难受死了，第二天一早6点多叫我在想想办法，后来上京东一看256G有货可以当天送到，只得立马再订购一台。	My wife was extremely uncomfortable without a mobile phone. She woke me up at 6 o'clock the next morning to figure out a solution.

买来之后其他的都没什么问题，就是在软件连接的时候，怎么都连不上，我家是TP的路由器，上网查了之后发现好多人都有这个问题，弄了两个多小时，各种改路由器的设置，最后我用360WIFI作为媒介给弄好的，期间给小米客服打电话，他们对这个问题也没有什么解决方法，直接就让我联系亚马逊进行售后。	After purchasing, everything else was fine except for the software connection, which just couldn't connect.

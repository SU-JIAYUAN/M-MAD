.0 目标文件 (Object file)	.0 object file (Object file)	no
.a 归档库文件(Archive file)	.a Archive file (Archive file)	no
除非使用了 -cec，-s, 或 -E 选项(或者编译错误阻止了完整的过程),否则连接总是最后的步骤.	Linking is always the last step unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or compilation errors prevent the complete process).	no
在连接阶段中,所有对应于源程序的.e 文件，-1 库文件, 无法识别的文件名(包括指定的.o H 标文件和 .a 库文件)按命令行中的顺序传递给连接器选项 (OPTIONS)	In the connection phase, all .e files corresponding to source programs, -1 library files, and unrecognized file names (including specified .o H standard files and .a library files) are passed to the linker in the order in the command line OPTIONS	no
选项必须分立给出 : de ' 完全不同于 `-d -r '.	Options must be given separately: de 'is completely different from '-d -r '.	no
大多数 ` -=E :和 `-W' 选项有两个相反的格式 : -fname 和 -fno-name (或 -Wname 和 -Wno- name).	Most '-=E: and '-W' options have two opposite forms: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).	no
这里只列举不是默认选项的格式.	Only formats that are not the default options are listed here.	no
下面是所有选项的摘要, 按类型分组, 解释放在后面的章节中.	Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, with explanations in later sections.	no
代码生成选项 (Code Generation Option)	Code Generation Option	yes
总体选项 (Overall Option)	Overall Option	yes
明确指出后面输入文件的语言为 language (而不是从文件名后绥得到的默认选择).	Explicitly indicate that the language of subsequent input files is language (instead of the default selection from the filename suffix).	yes

关闭任何对语种的明确说明, 因此依据文件名后级处理后面的文件 RE AS E ` -x' 选项).	Turn off any explicit specification of the language, so subsequent files are processed according to the file name RE AS E '-x' option).	yes
如果只操作四个阶段( 预处理, 编译, 汇编, 连接)中的一部分, 可以使用 ` -x' 选项 (或文件名后 Ah) 告诉 geo 从哪里开始,用 `~-c' ，`-s' ,或 `-E' 选项告诉 geo 到哪里结束.注意,某些选项组合 (例如 ，`-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c 编译或汇编源文件, ETER. ERA ATI 缺省情况下， GCC 通过用 ` .o' 蔡换源文件名后级 ` .ec 标文件名. 可以使用-o 选项选择其他名字.GCC忽略 -ec 选项后面任何无法识别的输入文伯 -S F 何事情.	If you only operate part of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking), you can use the '-x' option (or Ah after the file name) to tell geo where to start, use '~-c', '-s', or the '-E' option tells geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (for example, '-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC replaces source file names with '.o' followed by '.ec'. Other names can be selected using the -o option.	yes
了的目标文件.	the target file.	yes
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	Stops after compiling, no assembly is performed.	yes
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	Use pipes instead of temporary files to work between different stages of the compilation process, because the assemblers on those systems cannot read from pipes. The GNU assembler does not have this problem. C "dialects" accepted by assemblers: Support ANSI compliant C programs.	yes
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This will turn off some of the feature keywords in GNU Cc that are not compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as the ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax that are denoted as welcome and rarely used, and even if used (Note: Hosted environment (hosted environment) is available in all standard libraries, the main function returns an int value, a typical example is almost all programs except the kernel. The corresponding independent environment (f£reestanding environment) does not exist in the standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website)	yes
对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	For function declarations without parameters, such as'int foo ();', treat them C-style --- that is, do not specify the number or types of parameters. (C++ only).	no
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	Normally, such a function foo means in C++ that the argument is empty.	no
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	Section listings are cut here to try to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.	no
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	See the NU c manual for details, we've removed the details so that people don't HERI when the content becomes obsolete.	no
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the '-traditional' option has the added effect of allowing assignment to this.	no
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	It has the same effect as the '-Ethis-is-variable' option.	no
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp Attempts to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.	no
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	Specifically what is mentioned above about the preprocessor, but not other effects of the '-traditional' option.	no
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	-fdollars-in-identifiers Allow '$' characters in identifiers (C++ only).	no
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	You can specify the '"-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly disable the '$' character.	no
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	(GNU C++ allows the '$' character by default on some target systems, but not all.)	no
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	-fenum-int-equiv Allow implicit conversion of ant types to enumeration types (MEF c++).	no
正常情况下 GNU C++ 允许从 enum 到 int 的转换,反之则不行.	Normally GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.	no
-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	-fexternal--templates Generate smaller code (c++ only) for template declarations by, for each template function, making a copy only where they are defined.	no
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	To successfully use this option, you must mark '#pragma implementatio' (definition) or '#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files using templates.	no
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	When a program is compiled with '-fexternal-templates ', template instantiations are all external types. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.	no
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	This can be achieved with typedefs, which refer to each instance needed.	no
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	Correspondingly, when compiling with the default '-fno-exteznal-templates' option, all template instances are explicitly set as built-ins.	no
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All member functions (except constructor functions and the mnew or delete member operators) are treated as virtual functions of the enclosing class.	no
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	This does not mean that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.	no
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it will be called directly.	no
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch Allow type mismatch between the second and third arguments of the condition expression.	no
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	The value of such an expression is Void. -fthis--is-variable allows assignment to this (c++ only).	no
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	Incorporating user-defined free storage management into C++ made assignable'this' anachronistic.	no
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	Therefore, by default, assignment to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.	no
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	However, for backwards compatibility, you can enable this with the '-fthis-is-variable' option.	no
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	-funsigned-char Define char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.	no
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Various machines have their own default char type. It may be unsigned char or signed char.	no
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the signedness of the data.	no
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	But many programs have been written to use only plain char, and expect this to be signed (or unsigned, depending on the machine the program is written for).	no
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This option, and its inverse, make that program work on the corresponding default.	no
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	The type of char should always be explicitly defined as either signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.	no
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	If no'signed' or "unsigned' modifiers are explicitly specified, these options are used to define signed or unsigned bitfields.	no
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	By default, bitfields are signed, because the underlying integer types they inherit from, such as int, are signed, however, if the '-traditional' option is specified, bitfields are always unsigned.	no
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	-fwritable-strings Store string constants in the writable data segment, and do not treat them specially.	no
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	This is for compatibility with older programs, who consider changing string constants to be a very bad idea. The '-traditional' option has the same effect.	no

无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。	Drug use is more common in urban areas than in rural areas, both in developed and developing countries.	no
吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。	The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the massive movement of people from rural to urban areas - more than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.	no
城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。	Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, especially in developing countries where urbanization tends to be more pronounced.	no

这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。	These patterns appear to be less common in wealthier social classes.	no
全球新冠肺炎危机造成的经济制约很可能会加剧包括吸毒者在内的最弱势群体的风险。	The economic constraints imposed by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.	no
例如，劳动力市场的变化，如失业率上升，过去一直与吸毒情况的增加有关，而这场疫情己经迫使全球数千万人失业。	For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked in the past to increased drug use, and the pandemic has forced tens of millions of people out of work around the world.	no
新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。	COVID-19 may lead to further expansion of drug market The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to more farmers to increase or engage in illicit crops, either because the control capacity of national authorities is reduced, or because in the economic crisis more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities.	no
新冠肺炎的相关限制措施导致空中和陆路交通减少，海上贩运可能已经因此而增加，海上的拦截风险低，而且比空中或陆路走私的数量更多。	Trafficking by sea may have increased as a result of reduced air and land traffic due to COVID-19-related restrictions, where the risk of interception is low and higher volumes are smuggled than by air or land.	no

对前体化学品的管制迫使制毒者进行创新最常作为前体用来合成苯丙胺、甲基苯丙胺和“摇头丸”等毒品的许多化学品已被置于国际管制之下。	Control of precursor chemicals forces drugmakers to innovate Many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors in the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.	no
贩毒者和制毒者一直在寻找替代品一不仅有管制较松的物质，还有专门为规避管制而设计的化学品，即所谓的“特制前体”。	Drug traffickers and producers are always looking for alternatives - not just less regulated substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to circumvent them, so-called "designer precursors."	no
旨在阻止新冠肺炎传播的限制性措施很可能使依赖前体化学品的制毒者受到进一步挤压。	Restrictive measures aimed at halting the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug makers who rely on precursor chemicals.	no
来自墨西哥的证据表明，这已经成为 现实：据报告，2020年3月，从东亚进口的甲基苯丙胺前体短缺促使墨西哥和美国的甲基苯丙胺价格上涨。	Evidence from Mexico suggests that this is already a reality: in March 2020, shortages of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia were reported to have contributed to increases in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.	no

阿富汗和伊拉克甲基苯丙胺市场增长	Methamphetamine market growth in Afghanistan and Iraq	no
早在2012年，对医院、监狱和其他机构人员的调查就已经揭示了甲基苯丙胺在伊拉克的重要性。	As early as 2012, investigations of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.	no
结晶甲基苯丙胺已经成为“芬乃他林”和曲马多之外又一种令人担忧的主要药物。	Crystalline methamphetamine has become a major drug of concern alongside "captagon" and tramadol.	no

在其他国家大量缉获了据认为源自阿富汗的甲基苯丙胺，这也表明该国的产量正在迅速上升。	Large seizures in other countries of methamphetamine thought to have originated in Afghanistan also suggest that production in that country is rapidly rising.	no
政策变化和变化趋势	Policy Changes and Trends	yes
非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域大多有大麻使用增多的趋势	Jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical use of cannabis show a trend towards increased cannabis use	yes
加拿大、乌拉圭和美国的11个法域允许制造大麻产品供非医疗使用。	Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.	yes
在其中多数法域，大麻使用自合法化以来有所增多，尽管在其他未将非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域也观察到了同样的趋势。	In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized the non-medical use of cannabis.	yes
在美国最早通过立法的两个州科罗拉多州和华盛顿州，成年人非医疗使用大麻的情况增加，特别是过去一个月以及每天或几乎每天使用的情况增多，自2012年起便已超过了全国平均水平。	In Colorado and Washington, two of the first U.S. states to pass legislation, non-medical use of marijuana among adults has increased, particularly in the past month and daily or near-daily use, exceeding the national average since 2012 level.	yes

然而，2019年仍有40%的大麻使用者靠非法来源获得某些产品。	However, 40% of cannabis users in 2019 still obtained some products from illicit sources.	yes
全球大麻药草缉获量暴跌的背后原因是大麻合法化？	Is marijuana legalization behind plummeting global marijuana herb seizures?	yes
2018年，全球大麻药草缉获量降至20年来的最低水平，这是因为北美的缉获量下降，在过去10年中下降了 84%。	Global seizures of cannabis herb fell to their lowest level in 20 years in 2018, as seizures in North America fell, falling by 84% over the past 10 years.	no
相比之下，同期世界其他地区的缉获量几乎翻了一番。缉获的模式表明，旨在放开大麻市场的政策在下降中发挥了关键作用。	In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the marijuana market played a key role in the decline.	no
对新型精神活性物质的监管似乎有遏制作用在国内对新型精神活性物质的监管效果仍然很难评估。	Regulation of NPS appears to have a deterrent effect The domestic regulation of NPS remains difficult to assess.	no
一些对新型精神活性物质采用不同监管制度的国家显示出不同的新型精神活性物质使用流行率。	Some countries with different regulatory regimes for NPS show different prevalence of NPS use.	no

获取药用类阿片的障碍与许多因素有关，包括立法、文化、卫生系统和处方做法。	Barriers to access to pharmaceutical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescribing practices.	no
较贫穷的人患吸毒病症的风险更大2018年约有3,560万人患有吸毒病症。	Poorer people are at greater risk of developing a substance use disorder Some 35.6 million people suffered from a substance use disorder in 2018.	no
贫困、有限的教育和社会边缘化可能会增加吸毒病症风险，并加剧其后果。高收入国家的研宄证实了这一点，在这些研究中，个人不利的社会经济轨迹一不仅仅是他们在某一时间点的状况一也与吸毒病症风险有关。	Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of substance use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. This is confirmed by studies in high-income countries where individuals' unfavorable socioeconomic trajectories - not just their status at a certain point in time - are also associated with drug use disorder risk.	no
吸毒病症还会加深社会经济劣势，进一步增加失业、贫困和无家可归的风险，从而助长劣势的恶性循环。这些结果也可能与刑事司法系统内的侮辱性态度和后果有关。	Drug use disorders can also deepen socioeconomic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby contributing to a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These results may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.	no

全球范围的有限数据表明，迷醉可能是杀人的一个重要因素。	Limited data worldwide suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.	no
但在暴力事件中，酒精的作用似乎比毒品更大。	But alcohol appears to play a bigger role than drugs in violent incidents.	no
虽然吸毒可能会导致犯罪，但在某些情况下，这种联系可以部分归因于多种中介因素，如社会经济劣势以及由个人风险、家庭环境和同龄人影响造成的其他类型的逆境。	While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases this association can be attributed in part to multiple mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity resulting from personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.	no
贩毒和暴力之间的联系是多方面的。	The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.	no
如果已有稳定的犯罪结构，包括国际贩毒在内的大规模有组织犯罪活动有可能在无暴力的情况下实施。	Large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, is likely to be carried out without violence if stable criminal structures are in place.	no
短期内，暴力的存在和程度与其说取决于贩运的数量，不如说取决于造成有组织犯罪集团之间力量平衡不稳定的某些变化，例如非法市场规模的变化，知名罪犯的死亡或监禁，以及使一个集团弱于另一个集团的执法措施。	In the short term, the presence and extent of violence depend less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or incarceration of high-profile criminals, and enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.	no
最新趋势	latest trends	yes
吸毒大麻是最常用的物质，类阿片危害最大	Marijuana is most commonly used substance, opioids most harmful	yes
据估计，2018年使用大麻的有 1.92 亿人，使之成为全球使用最多的毒品。	An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug globally.	yes
相比之下，2018年使用类阿片的有5,800万人。	In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.	yes
但阿片类药物的相关危害却因使用者较少而受到忽视。	But the harms associated with opioids have been overlooked due to the low number of users.	yes
在2017年与吸毒病症有关的估计167,000例死亡中，有66%是这类物质造成的，在据信为吸毒导致的残疾或过早死亡而损失的2,100万年寿命中，有50%是这类物质造成的。	Substances were responsible for 66 percent of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to substance use disorders in 2017 and 50 percent of the 21 million years of life believed to be lost to drug-related disability or premature death.	yes
合成类阿片的非医疗使用加剧了公共卫生危机	Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis	yes
在西非、中部非洲和北非，加剧类阿片危机的是曲马多；在北美则是芬太尼。这两个区域在经济、人口统计数据或一般吸毒模式方面几乎没有共同点，但都在奋力抗击由容易获得且生产成本低的物质助长的类阿片危机。	In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that is fueling the opioid crisis; in North America it is fentanyl. The two regions, which have little in common in terms of economics, demographics or general drug use patterns, are struggling to combat an opioid crisis fueled by readily available and cheaply produced substances.	yes
在北美，芬太尼等合成类阿片的使用导致了20年来类阿片过量致死人数增加。	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has contributed to a 20-year increase in opioid overdose deaths.	yes
2018年，在美国登记的67,367例过量死亡中，有三分之二涉及芬太尼。	In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.	yes
加拿大也报告了类似的结果，只是数字较低。	Canada reported similar results, albeit with lower numbers.	no
芬太尼导致过量死亡的部分原因是非法药物市场上的芬太尼药效不可预测。	Part of the reason fentanyl is responsible for overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl in the illicit drug market.	no
在西非、中部非洲和北非，非医疗用途曲马多的市场已有大幅增长。	The market for non-medical use of tramadol has grown significantly in West, Central and North Africa.	no
在该区域，接受治疗的曲马多使用病症患者越来越多。	There is an increasing number of patients receiving treatment for tramadol use disorders in the region.	no
2017年，全球截获的曲马多数量显著增加，达到125吨以上的峰值。	The amount of tramadol intercepted globally increased significantly in 2017, peaking at more than 125 tons.	no
但2018年，在印度通过一项监管曲马多的新法律之后，全球缉获量降至32吨。	But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating tramadol, global seizures fell to 32 tons.	no
促成这两地危机的是制造简单和生产成本低，此外还有对曲马多和许多芬太尼类似物或其前体缺乏国际监管。	Contributing to the crisis in both places is the simplicity and low cost of production, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogs or their precursors.	no
使这两地危机恶化的是这些物质在药品市场和非法市场上都有供应，因而更加难以发现和防止其滥用。	Compounding the crisis in both places is the fact that these substances are available in both pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making their abuse even more difficult to detect and prevent.	no
兴奋剂使用不断增多	Doping use on the rise	no
兴奋剂领域以可卡因和甲基苯丙胺为主，这两种物质在其主要市场的使用量都在上升。	The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are seeing rising use in their major markets.	no
2018年使用可卡因的约有1,900万人，因为可卡因在北美和西欧颇为流行。	About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is prevalent in North America and Western Europe.	no
同年使用苯丙胺的约有2,700万人，其中甲基苯丙胺是东南亚和北美使用最多的苯丙胺类兴奋剂。	About 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most used ATS in South-East Asia and North America.	no
根据所掌握的多数指标，20年来这两个区域甲基苯丙胺的使用一直在扩大。	According to most indicators available, methamphetamine use has been increasing in both regions for 20 years.	no
在一些市场上，可卡因和甲基苯丙胺可以共存，有时是相互替代，这样一种药物的使用量上升时另一种药物的使用量就下降，有时是同时增加和减少以满足同一市场的需求。	In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can co-exist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that use of one drug rises while the use of the other falls, sometimes both increasing and decreasing to meet demand in the same market.	no
新冠肺炎使注射吸毒者的风险增高	COVID-19 Puts Injecting Drug Users at Higher Risk	no
据估计，2018年注射吸毒的约有1,130万人，全球艾滋病毒感染约有10%是注射吸毒造成的。	An estimated 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections are attributable to injecting drug use.	no
注射吸毒者感染艾滋病毒的超过100万人，患丙型肝炎的有550万人。	More than 1 million people who inject drugs are infected with HIV and 5.5 million with hepatitis C.	no
2017年，因吸毒死亡的约有 58.5万人，其中一半死于丙型肝炎引起的肝病，而注射吸毒者的丙型肝炎大多仍未得到治疗。	Of the estimated 585,000 drug deaths in 2017, half were due to liver disease caused by hepatitis C, which remains largely untreated among people who inject drugs.	no
5 新冠肺炎限制措施造成的类阿片短缺可能导致使用者代之以酒精或苯二氮类药物等更容易获得的物质，或者将类阿片与合成药物混合。	5 Opioid shortages caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute for more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.	no
随着一些使用者改用注射或更频繁地注射，可能会出现更多有害的使用方式。	More harmful patterns of use may emerge as some users switch to injections or inject more frequently.	no

欧盟峰会为难民政策争吵不休，欧盟官员：接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈	EU summit quarrels over refugee policy, EU officials: There are bottlenecks in every step of the admission process	yes
【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	[Global Times Special Correspondent Niu Ruifei in Belgium] According to Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit that day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration, which makes it easier to deport illegal immigrants.	yes
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	According to reports, the EU's move is in response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, which is now at the heart of the EU's low number of illegal immigrants who end up being deported.	yes
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funding" to strengthen external borders, including through infrastructure and surveillance.	yes
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	However, the EU has been at loggerheads with member states over issues such as payment for the fence.	yes
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not cover the costs.	yes
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	But diplomats in some member states said if the EU shared the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along its external borders, it would free up national budgets and speed up the process.	yes
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	According to the European Euractiv website, EU officials admit that there are bottlenecks in every step of the refugee admission process. "Permanent Crisis."	yes
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half compared to the previous year.	yes
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	Meanwhile, the European Union recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.	no
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	Against this backdrop, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries could deport illegal immigrants based on a court decision in another member state.	no
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	In addition, the report said, EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of a safe state," which will open the way for the EU to develop a common list.	no

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	The United States escalates its "chip war" and hits the global semiconductor industry hard-Chinanews.com	yes
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	Recently, the U.S. "chip war" against China has been escalating. First, under the pressure of the U.S., the Netherlands and Japan agreed to start controlling the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; later, foreign media reported that the U.S. government is considering cutting off all connections between U.S. suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting U.S. suppliers from supplying any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order to restrict U.S. investment in the sensitive Chinese technology industry... 2023 will soon begin, the U.S. has continued to make evil moves to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.	yes
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	In recent years, the United States has never stopped cracking down on the development of China's "chips." While precisely suppressing the semiconductor production and supply chain to China, it is building a "de-Sinicization" semiconductor industry chain alliance in an attempt to completely "get rid of" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.	yes
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it is to win over South Korea to establish a "technical alliance," or to establish a chip "four-party alliance" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a semiconductor industry chain through mechanisms such as the "four-party mechanism" of the United States, Japan, India and Australia, and the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework," the United States has introduced the semiconductor industry by means of politicization, blocization, and weaponization, in an attempt to build a closed production and supply chain led by the United States, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.	yes
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	However, the US's "core tactics" against China with great fanfare is also "injury to the enemy by one thousand and self-injury to eight hundred."	yes
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	Recently, Fanlin Group, a well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier in the United States, announced that due to the latest round of export ban on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.	yes
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	The global lithography machine giant ASML recently warned that the ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China may lead to higher semiconductor prices.	yes
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	According to US media analysis, after the US government imposed brutal suppression on China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies have suffered greatly, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves.	yes
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.	yes
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain has long been formed.	yes
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	According to estimates by professionals, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the borders of various countries more than 70 times, and the whole process takes 100 days.	no
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially in advanced manufacturing processes, and relies heavily on East Asia.	no
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	Even if the United States tries its best to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the regional development of the "small circle" led by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries are difficult to change.	no
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The United States has vigorously "reshaped" and "de-Sinicized" the semiconductor industry chain, severely damaging the global semiconductor industry.	no
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the participation of all countries in the world.	no
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively promulgating the "Innovation and Competition Act," "American Competition Act of 2022," "Chips and Science Act," using technological hegemony to consolidate its leading edge in technology; it has forced Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other chip manufacturers to set up factories in the United States, trying to ensure the United States' global leadership in the chip field.	no
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	In the short term, the United States has indeed caused troubles for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and has reaped real benefits.	no
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	But in the long run, the hysterical suppression by the United States has forced China's chip industry to make continuous breakthroughs, depriving itself of the huge Chinese market, which will eventually greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of American technology companies and damage the development of the global chip industry.	no

首批个人养老金理财产品发售，标志着个人养老金投资者可正式通过个人养老金资金账户购买理财产品。	The launch of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marks that individual pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.	no
去年11月银保监会制定了《商业银行和理财公司个人养老金业务管理暂行办法 》 。	In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the "Interim Measures for the Administration of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies."	no
《办法》规定，参加人可以通过个人养老金资金账户购买个人养老储蓄、个人养老金理财产品、个人养老金保险产品、个人养老金公募基金产品等个人养老金产品。	The "Measures" stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public offering fund products and other personal pension products through their personal pension fund accounts.	no
随后，人社部、财政部、国家税务总局三部门发布通知，明确个人养老金制度在北京、天津，以及河北石家庄、雄安新区，山西晋城市等36个先行城市和地区启动实施。	Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice specifying that the personal pension system will be implemented in 36 leading cities and regions including Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang in Hebei, Xiongan New District, and Jincheng in Shanxi.	no

一是稳健性，风险管理机制更加健全，投资策略和理念更为稳健，并实施非母行第三方独立托管。	The first is robustness. The risk management mechanism is more complete, the investment strategy and philosophy are more stable, and the third-party independent custody of the non-parent bank is implemented.	no

专业人士指出，投资者要根据产品特点和自己的风险承受能力进行选择。	Professionals pointed out that investors should make choices based on product characteristics and their own risk tolerance.	no
个人养老金储蓄具有期限较长、利率较高、安全性高的特点，适合风险承受能力弱的人群；个人养老金保险产品重在保障，比较适合无法承担投资风险，可以接受稳定收益的人群；而个人养老金理财产品和公募基金产品不保本也不保收益，有一定投资风险，但预期收益较高，适合具备一定的金融知识、风险承担能力较高的人群。	Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long term, high interest rate, and high security, which are suitable for people with weak risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection, and are more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks but can accept stable returns; however, personal pension wealth management products and public offering fund products do not guarantee capital or income, and have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are relatively high, and they are suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk-taking ability.	no

健身行业应摆脱信任危机-中新网	The fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust-Chinanews.com	yes
又一大型健身房“暴雷”？	Another large gym "thunderstorm"?	yes
近日，知名健身机构中健健身会员维权问题引起社会关注。	Recently, the well-known fitness organization Zhongjian Fitness members' rights protection issues have attracted social attention.	yes
春节后不少会员发现自己所在门店没有正常营业，随后，关于该机构倒闭跑路的传闻引起会员恐慌，导致公安、人社部门介入。	After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Later, rumors about the organization's closure and escape caused panic among members, which led to the intervention of the public security and human resources and social security departments.	yes
最后，该机构相关负责人出面回应，承诺会努力保障好员工和会员的合法权益，风波才得以平息。	In the end, the relevant person in charge of the organization came forward to respond, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the turmoil subsided.	yes
个别健身机构的部分门店出现经营问题，暂时关闭，消费者本可心平气和等待问题解决，为何不少会员的第一反应是“大事不妙”？	Some stores of individual fitness institutions have business problems and are temporarily closed. Consumers can calmly wait for the problem to be resolved. Why do many members' first reaction is "something is not good"?	yes
健身俱乐部会员维权风波背后，是行业信任危机的深层次问题。	Behind the turmoil of fitness club members' rights protection is the deep-seated problem of the industry's trust crisis.	yes
国内传统健身房普遍采取预付费模式，“赚用户不来的钱”是其发展的底层逻辑。	Traditional domestic gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and "earning money that users can't come" is the underlying logic of their development.	yes
通过预售会员卡获取现金流，不断开新店，看似能够循环往复，实则寅吃卯粮，无法形成稳定的盈利模式。	Obtaining cash flow through the pre-sale of membership cards and constantly opening new stores seems to be able to repeat itself, but in fact, it is impossible to form a stable profit model.	yes
健身房跑路等行业负面信息频频传出，对消费者信心造成强烈冲击。	Negative information about industries such as running in the gym frequently spreads, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.	yes
从市场前景看，健身房当然算得上是一门有“钱途”的好生意。	From the perspective of market prospects, gyms can of course be regarded as a good business with "money prospects."	no
健身赛道虽然起起伏伏，但始终受到资本关注。	Although the fitness track has ups and downs, it has always attracted the attention of capital.	no
多项数据显示，文体消费等领域热度不断攀升，市场持续回暖。	A number of data show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption and other fields continues to rise, and the market continues to pick up.	no
具体到健身市场，随着居民生活水平稳步提高，健康生活理念深入人心，健身行业发展大有可为。	Specific to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the concept of healthy living deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the fitness industry has great potential for development.	no
形势越是趋好，行业越需重视发展质量。	The better the situation is, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.	no
然而，个别机构对消费复苏后的健身市场盲目乐观，刚从危机中走出来，又吹响开疆拓土的号角，把融资资金一股脑投入新店建设上。	However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption. Just after coming out of the crisis, they sounded the clarion call to expand the territory and invested all the financing funds into the construction of new stores.	no
不可否认，这几年受疫情影响，不少机构退出，行业重新洗牌，有实力的企业此时选择性地加大收购力度、重新布局，未尝不是新机遇。	It is undeniable that due to the impact of the epidemic in the past few years, many institutions have withdrawn and the industry has been reshuffled. At this time, powerful companies are selectively increasing their acquisitions and reorganizing their layout. This may not be a new opportunity.	no
但是，健身市场发展要想进入良性循环，迈上行稳致远的康庄大道，行业就必须改变传统模式，改变经营策略。	However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous circle and take a steady and long-term path, the industry must change the traditional model and change its business strategy.	no
只有稳扎稳打，重新建立起消费者的信任度、安全感，才能真正赢得市场、赢得未来。	Only by working steadily and re-establishing the trust and sense of security of consumers can we truly win the market and win the future.	no
相比大建新店抢占市场，健身行业当前更需要的是沉下心来优化服务，用高质量发展来稳住用户。	Compared with building new stores to seize the market, what the fitness industry needs now is to settle down to optimize services and stabilize users with high-quality development.	no
首先，要靠服务留住用户。	First of all, it is necessary to rely on services to retain users.	no
健身房属于服务行业，其本质是坚持“用户导向”，要紧紧围绕用户需求，把经营重心放在服务提质升级上。	Gyms belong to the service industry, and its essence is to adhere to the "user orientation," closely focus on user needs, and focus on improving service quality and upgrading.	no
其次，要靠数字化转型提升用户体验。	Second, rely on digital transformation to improve user experience.	no
比如当下流行的互联网健身房模式，实现用户按次付费和场地自选。	For example, the current popular Internet gym model enables users to pay per view and choose venues on their own.	no
同时，身体数据、运动数据得以有效利用，还可以满足社交需求，实现从线上到线下完整的服务闭环。	At the same time, body data and sports data can be effectively used to meet social needs and realize a complete closed-loop service from online to offline.	no
没有私教推销，没有巨额年卡，用户对健身机构“跑路”的担忧降低了，信任感也就提升了。	There is no personal training promotion, no huge annual card, users are less worried about "running away" from fitness institutions, and their sense of trust is also improved.	no
另外，还要积极探索多元业态。	In addition, we should actively explore diversified business forms.	no
如今，体育消费已经从单一服务走向场景消费，健身俱乐部有望成为消费新入口，围绕健身所需的运动补给和健身器械等周边产品或将成为新的盈利点，为消费者提供更丰富选择。	Today, sports consumption has shifted from a single service to scene consumption. Fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption. Peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.	no

“保价协议”条件可不少	There are many conditions for the "guaranteed price agreement"	yes
这家位于江北新区的楼盘名为保利扬子萃云台，看房人孙先生告诉记者，他在上周末逛楼盘时发现了一则“声明”。	This real estate located in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyun Terrace. Mr. Sun, the viewer, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he was shopping for real estate last weekend.	yes
他发给记者的图片上显示，该楼盘的开发商承诺，凡是在2月1日-2月28日期间购买房源的，自双方签订买卖合同之日起至对应房源交付，若该项目其他房源的优惠折扣大于之前购房所享折扣的(限与该商品房属于同一户型、同一楼栋、同一单元、同一物业类型的其他未售商品房)，开发商可以为购房者换房并退还差价。	The picture he sent to the reporter shows that the developer of the real estate promises that anyone who purchases a house between February 1 and February 28 will start from the date when the two parties sign the sales contract until the corresponding house is delivered. If the preferential discount of other houses is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous house purchase (limited to other unsold commercial houses of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type as the commercial house), the developer can change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.	yes
孙先生表示，置业顾问表示这其实就是一份“保价协议”，目的是让买家放心出手，不用担心开发企业降价促销，“现在就怕买完了它就降价了，去售楼处闹吧没时间，不闹的话也确实窝心”。	Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually a "price protection agreement," the purpose is to let buyers feel at ease and don't have to worry about the price reduction of the development company. "Now I'm afraid that the price will be reduced after buying it. Go to the sales office to make trouble. No time, if you don't make trouble, it's really heartwarming."	yes
还有不少买房人则认为，“保价协议”虽然是在给购房者吃“定心丸”，不过条件却不低。	There are still many house buyers who believe that although the "price protection agreement" is to give house buyers "reassurance," the conditions are not low.	yes
打算在江北买一套刚需房的郑女士说，保价的房源首先是要同一户型，还得在同一楼栋、同一个单元，买家可以比价的房源寥寥，因此“门槛”还是蛮高的。	Ms. Zheng, who intends to buy a new house in Jiangbei, said that the price-insured house must first be of the same type, and must be in the same building and the same unit. There are very few houses that buyers can compare prices, so the "threshold" is still quite high.	yes
也有购房者认为，由于信息不对称，销售时不排除给出额外的让利，买家“维权”的难度不小。	There are also buyers who believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not ruled out that additional concessions will be given during the sale, and it is not easy for buyers to "protect their rights."	yes
能否留住买房人有待观察	Whether it can keep house buyers remains to be seen	no
记者在南京网上房地产上查询得知，该楼盘于去年11月首领两幢楼共计252套房源的销许，户型面积有105平方米、114平方米、129平方米等，全装修销许均价为39843元/㎡。	The reporter inquired on the real estate online in Nanjing and learned that the real estate sold a total of 252 suites in two buildings in November last year. The price is 39843 yuan/m2.	no
不过两个多月过去，网上房地产显示目前该楼盘的未售总套数为157套，占比为62.3%，其中8号楼共计128套，未售套数达113套，7号楼的124套中也有44套未售，项目的总成交套数只有33套，占比仅为13%。	However, more than two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in this building is 157, accounting for 62.3%. There are also 44 unsold sets, and the total number of transactions of the project is only 33 sets, accounting for only 13%.	no
市场人士介绍，“保价协议”在2008年也曾在南京出现过。	According to market sources, the "guaranteed price agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.	no
当年8月份，河西黄山路上的楼盘横塘西苑为了吸引买房人眼球，推出了《保价计划》，具体内容为“公司郑重承诺，若一年内项目优惠幅度扩大，由此产生的差额，公司将按差额退还给老业主”。	In August of that year, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate project on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched the "Price Guarantee Plan" in order to attract the attention of house buyers. The specific content was "The company solemnly promises that if the preferential margin of the project is expanded within a year, the difference will be refunded to the old owner."	no
此后2011年4月，南京也有9家楼盘拿出部分房源承诺“差价赔付”。	Afterwards, in April 2011, 9 real estate properties in Nanjing took out part of their listings and promised to "compensate for the price difference."	no
“楼市在回暖，此时更需要一针‘强心剂’。	"The property market is picking up, and at this time we need a shot of'heart booster'.	no
”南京地产行业一位资深操盘手沈先生表示，“保价协议”也是房企的营销方式之一。	"Mr. Shen, a senior trader in the Nanjing real estate industry, said that the "price protection agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of real estate companies.	no
他认为如今开发企业比买房人更需要信心，推出“保价协议”其实也是在给其打气。	He believes that development companies need more confidence than house buyers nowadays, and the launch of the "price protection agreement" is actually to encourage them.	no
至于能否留住买房人，他表示这取决于调控政策、贷款门槛等多重因素的影响，就目前来看仍有待观察。	As for whether the buyers can be retained, he said that it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, and it remains to be seen at present.	no

新华社台北2月11日电(记者赵博、黄扬)出口贸易额“连五黑”，制造业采购经理人指数(PMI)连续7个月紧缩，消费者物价指数(CPI)又见“3字头”……近期，台湾当局陆续发布2023年1月经济数据。	Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11 (reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) The export trade volume is "five blacks in a row," the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) has shrunk for seven consecutive months, and the consumer price index (CPI) has seen "3 prefix..."Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.	yes

统计显示，1月台湾地区进出口双降，出超金额仅23.4亿美元，创近3年来最低水平。	Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports both fell in January, and the excess amount was only US$2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.	yes
台当局财政事务主管部门认为，全球终端需求减少，产业调整库存抑制厂商购料意愿，出口颓势短期难见改善，台湾今年首季出口衰退恐高于预期。	The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that the decline in global end-use demand and the adjustment of industrial inventories have restrained manufacturers' willingness to purchase materials. The decline in exports will hardly improve in the short term. Taiwan's export decline in the first quarter of this year may be higher than expected.	no
据台湾中华经济研究院发布，今年1月台湾制造业采购经理人指数(PMI)经季节调整后为40.4%，较去年12月续跌3.3个百分点，连续7个月紧缩。	According to Taiwan's Zhonghua Economic Research Institute, Taiwan's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in January this year was 40.4% after seasonal adjustment, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and contracted for seven consecutive months.	no

其中，蔬菜价格飞涨28.25%，创17个月新高。	Among them, vegetable prices soared 28.25%, hitting a 17-month high.	no
台“主计总处”专门委员曹志弘坦言，菜价涨幅确实超乎预期，排除春节因素，今年1月和2月平均CPI应接近去年12月的2.71%，通胀压力还是存在，且仍在高点。	Cao Zhihong, a special committee member of Taiwan's "General Office of Accounting and Accounting," said frankly that the increase in vegetable prices has indeed exceeded expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year. Inflationary pressure still exists and is still high.	no
展望今年台湾经济，综合《联合报》、“Yahoo财经”等岛内媒体报道，专家表示悲观。	Looking forward to Taiwan's economy this year, experts expressed pessimism based on the reports of Taiwan's media such as "United Daily News" and "Yahoo Finance."	no
台“中央大学”经济系教授吴大任分析，出口衰退可能造成出口制造业厂商现金流出现问题，债务违约风险上升。	Wu Daren, a professor of economics at Taiwan's "Central University," analyzed that the decline in exports may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies and increase the risk of debt default.	no
同时，订单减少导致厂商削减人力成本，影响劳动市场和家庭经济，反过来冲击消费能力。	At the same time, the reduction in orders leads manufacturers to cut labor costs, which affects the labor market and the household economy, which in turn impacts consumption capacity.	no
台湾经济研究院研究员邱达生认为，今年欧美通胀状况未解，需求持续萎缩，预估台湾出口衰退会延续到上半年。	Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States is still unresolved this year, and demand continues to shrink. It is estimated that the decline in Taiwan's exports will continue into the first half of the year.	no

“无内容，不电商”，随着短视频和直播电商不断发展，人们对电商内容的要求和标准正步入新阶段。	"No content, no e-commerce," with the continuous development of short video and live broadcast e-commerce, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.	no

报告认为，电商行业内容生态是一个综合性概念，是将电商与内容进行整合，但并非所有内容都可与电商整合，好的PGC(专业生产内容)与UGC(用户原创内容)才是与电商进行整合的优质载体，内容平台价值越高，消费与推广的场景也就越来越丰富，电商植入的可能性也就越高，商业价值也就越强，这种公共领域和私人领域逐步集成分布的电商内容生产和内容消费的比例也就会越高。	The report believes that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (professional production content) and UGC (user-generated content) are high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the more abundant the consumption and promotion scenarios, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, and the stronger the commercial value.

他表示，就内容价值而言，当前电商行业已经从“消费可及性”过渡到“消费品质化”阶段，优质、专业、差异化的内容是电商行业的“硬通货”。	He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumption accessibility" to "consumption quality," and high-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.	no
同时，内容成为电商发展新阶段的根本和抓手，知识付费、专业性知识、KOL(关键意见领袖)等PGC内容开始在电商直播中成为标配。	At the same time, content has become the foundation and starting point of the new stage of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, and KOL (Key Opinion Leader) has begun to become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.	no
展望电商行业的未来发展，喻国明提出两方面的建议。	Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.	no
一个是从内容结构提升的角度看，推动电商内容生态健康程度和质量整体提升，打造正向内容创作和管理标准，实现电商行业内容生态健康系统指数与动态均衡。	One is to promote the overall improvement of the ecological health and quality of e-commerce content from the perspective of content structure improvement, create positive content creation and management standards, and realize the index and dynamic balance of the e-commerce industry content ecological health system.	no
另一个是从外部生态看，要实现内容电商行业的健康发展和外部环境的价值协同与共创。	The other is from the perspective of external ecology, it is necessary to realize the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.	no

这些迹象让外界怀疑金主爱是否已经被内定为金氏政权的继承人，《华盛顿邮报》分析认为“这是金正恩把中学年纪的女儿推上接班人地位的讯号”，不过也有观点认为，这样的判断仍为时过早，在金正恩膝下有儿子的情况中，仍保有各种可能性。	These signs make the outside world doubt whether Kim Joo-ae has been designated as the successor of the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong-un is pushing his middle-school-aged daughter to the position of successor." However, there are also views that such a judgment is still too early. In the case of Kim Jong-un having a son, there are still various possibilities.	no
重阳问答︱如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Chongyang Q&A - How to view the US non-agricultural employment data in January exceeded expectations and future trends - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website	yes
Q：请问重阳投资，如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势？	Q: May I ask Chongyang Investment, what do you think of the US non-agricultural employment data in January exceeding expectations and the future trend?	yes
A：2月3日美国劳工部公布2023年1月非农就业数据，新增非农就业51.7万人，大幅高于市场预期的18.9万人；失业率降至3.4%，为近50年以来的最低位；时薪同比增速4.4%，环比增速0.3%，略有放缓。	A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the non-agricultural employment data for January 2023. New non-agricultural employment was 517,000, much higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest level in the past 50 years; hourly wages increased by 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, a slight slowdown.	yes
从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	From the perspective of the total amount, there are many one-time and technical disturbances in the data this time, such as the faculty and staff returning to work on strike, the revision of the survey statistics, and the update of the seasonal adjustment factor, which may be revised in the future (refer to 2022 1 The increase in non-agricultural employment was revised down from 504,000 to 364,000), and non-agricultural employment may not be as strong as the data suggests.	yes
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; new employment in high-touch service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care has rebounded sharply, and data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.	yes
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Combined with the rebound in service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor gap data, which also exceeded expectations, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has ushered in a quick recovery after extreme weather and holidays.	yes
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	We believe that the tight supply and demand in the US job market will hardly improve without going through a recession.	yes
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	At present, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, while the labor force participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor force participation rate of 25-54 years old is close to the pre-epidemic high.	yes
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	In addition, due to the strength of excess savings of American residents and consumer credit, strong consumer demand will further lag the impact of tightening policies on the job market.	yes
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	The continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be the background of the U.S. economy in 2023.	yes
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	Superposition is now approaching the end of interest rate hikes, and inflation expectations continue to fluctuate. We are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.	no
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Before the release of the data, the US stock, bond and exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Fed's rate hike path.	no
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Fed has shortened the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining the fragile balance of market inflation expectations. However, the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statement. It not only expects to stop raising interest rates early, but also expects two cut interest rates.	no
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	In the context of tight supply and demand in the labor market and unclear impacts of tightening policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on raising interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded transactions may cause some damage to the market.	no
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	Nevertheless, the stubbornness of wage growth cannot change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. As the M2 data turned negative year-on-year and the leading indicators of various CPI sub-items gradually improved, the US CPI data has turned to a stage of rapid decline since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only form a foundation for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify. After the next inflation data is released, the market may enter a new round of games.	no
杉杉创始人郑永刚因突发心脏疾病过世 曾带领中国服装第一股转型 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan, died of a heart attack	yes
经济观察网 记者 郑淯心 2月11日，认证主体为杉杉控股有限公司（以下简称“杉杉控股 ” ） 的微信公众号发布讣告，杉杉企业创始人、杉杉控股董事局主席郑永刚因突发心脏疾病救治无效，于2023年2月10日去世，享年65岁。	Economic Observation Network reporter Zheng Yuxin On February 11, the WeChat public account of Shanshan Holding Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holding") issued an obituary. Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprise and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holding, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to ineffective treatment for heart disease.	yes
上世纪80年代，郑永刚担任国营棉纺厂的厂长，随着调任，1989年郑永刚成为杉杉股份的前身宁波云港服装总厂的厂长。	In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the factory director of the state-owned cotton spinning factory. After being transferred, Zheng Yonggang became the factory director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd. in 1989.	yes
2022年12月，在第二十届中国企业领袖年会暨第二十二届中国企业未来之星年会上，郑永刚在演讲中称，在上世纪90年代的中国西服市场，杉杉品牌的市占率曾高达37 % 。	In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Enterprise Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of Future Stars of Chinese Enterprises, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the Shanshan brand accounted for 37% of the market.	yes
1996年杉杉股份（600884.SH）上市，成为中国服装业第一家上市公司。	In 1996, Shanshan Co., Ltd. (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's garment industry.	yes
就在服装业务如日中天时，杉杉集团却开始转型，因为郑永刚意识到 ， “ 一旦市场放开，中国品牌自然会形成一个梯队式品牌市场，杉杉西服想一直独领风骚，长期成为国人的国服的可能性不大 ” 。	Just when the clothing business was in full swing, Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized, "Once the market is liberalized, Chinese brands will naturally form an echelon brand market, Shanshan suits want to always lead the way, it is unlikely to become the national service of Chinese people in the long term."	yes
1999年，杉杉开始研究企业转型，郑永刚回忆当年 ， “ 我们来到上海，寻求到底转型做什么，专门找了很多专家学者，连续不断地开一些诸葛亮会、务虚研讨会。	In 1999, Shanshan began to study enterprise transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai to find out what to do in transformation. We specially found many experts and scholars, and held some Zhuge Liang meetings and retreat seminars continuously.	yes
最后，我们设定了两个大的战略方向。	Finally, we set two major strategic directions.	yes
第一个方向是新能源新材料，另外一个是大健康有未来 ” 。	The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is that great health has a future."	yes
战略方向确定后，杉杉开始寻找合作，那时候鞍山热能院为鞍钢配套的炭素研究所在做国家863课题，科研经费不够，于是杉杉和鞍山热能院碳素研究所签署合作协议，共同推动国家863课题“中间相炭微球”项目产业化，从事负极材料的研发、生产和销售，在国内实现负极材料的商用推广。	After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, Anshan Institute of Thermal Energy's carbon research institute supporting Ansteel was working on the national 863 project, and the research funds were not enough, so Shanshan signed a cooperation agreement with the carbon research institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "mesophase carbon microspheres" project, engaged in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and realized the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.	yes
2001年，杉杉股份实现中间相炭微球的规模化生产，开始国产化替代，取代日本成为国内中间相炭微球主要供应商。	In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. realized the large-scale production of mesocarbon microspheres, and began to replace Japan as the main supplier of mesocarbon microspheres in China.	no
这是中国第一家锂离子电池负极材料生产企业，实现了锂离子电池负极材料国产化。	This is the first lithium-ion battery anode material manufacturer in China, realizing the localization of lithium-ion battery anode materials.	no
随着锂电池的应用迅速普及，杉杉股份的锂电池业务开始逐步发展，2007年锂电材料业务被写入了杉杉股份的主营业务，服装业务营收占比逐年减少，直至2013年，杉杉股份的锂电材料业务收入全面超过服装业务。	With the rapid popularization of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Shanshan Co., Ltd. began to develop gradually. In 2007, the lithium battery material business was included in the main business of Shanshan Co., Ltd., and the proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year until 2013. Shanshan's lithium battery material business has more revenue than its clothing business.	no
2021年2月，杉杉股份成功并购LG化学偏光片业务，进军LCD偏光片市场，并成立偏光片企业杉金光电，该领域技术含量比较高，杉杉的主要的竞争对手都是世界500强，如韩国三星、日本的住友化学、日东电工。	In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established Shanjin Optoelectronics, a polarizer company. This field has relatively high technology content. Shanshan's main competitors are all Fortune 500 companies, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko.	no
郑永刚曾分享过投后管理的心得 ， “ 中国的民营企业收购国际上的一些高科技企业，成功概率比较低，为什么那些收购会失败？	Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management, "The probability of success for Chinese private enterprises to acquire some international high-tech companies is relatively low. Why do those acquisitions fail?	no
因为大家都会去考虑，我花了那么多钱，我得去派人管对吧，这是通常会做的一个行为 ” ， 然而郑永刚则不同，杉杉收购成功的那一天，郑永刚就到杉金光电当众宣布，杉杉作为杉金的大股东，决定实施一企两制，除了郑永刚担任董事长，杉杉企业的人不派到杉金，采取授权经营的方式，原有的分配制度、企业文化、各项管理等模式不变。	Because everyone will think about it, I have spent so much money, I have to send someone to take care of it, right? This is a common behavior." However, Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day Shanshan's acquisition was successful, Zheng Yonggang went to Shanshan Optoelectronics publicly announced that Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shanjin, decided to implement one enterprise, two systems. Except for Zheng Yonggang as the chairman, Shanshan Enterprises will not send people to Shanjin, and adopt the method of authorization. The original distribution system, corporate culture, management and other models remain unchanged.	no

五角大楼说，第二个被击落的物体于周四晚上首次进入美国领空，在阿拉斯加东北部上空移动时被美国军方跟踪，飞行高度为1.2万米（4万英尺），其大小与一辆小型汽车差不多，与先前被击落的那个中国间谍气球相比要小很多。	The second downed object entered U.S. airspace for the first time Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeast Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), the Pentagon said. The car is about the same, much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.	yes
五角大楼还认为，目前没有迹象显示，这个物体是可操纵的。	The Pentagon also believes there is currently no indication that the object is manipulable.	yes
白宫国家安全委员会战略沟通协调员约翰·科比周五表示，虽然这个在高空飞行的物体的具体样子尚不清楚，但它“对民航飞机的安全构成了合理的威胁”。	White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator John Kirby said Friday that while the high-flying object's exact appearance was unclear, it "posed a legitimate threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."	yes

美国官方对这个物体的描述大致可以归纳为：大小相当于一辆小汽车，没有操纵杆，没有悬挂装置，飞行高度为一万米左右。	The US official description of this object can be roughly summarized as follows: the size is equivalent to a small car, there is no joystick, no suspension device, and the flying height is about 10,000 meters.	no
但这些信息还无法回答基本问题，比如这个物体究竟是什么东西，它属于哪个国家，它在执行什么任务。	But this information cannot yet answer basic questions, such as what the object really is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is performing.	no

也有人把阿拉斯加的这个“物体”与“不明飞行物”（UFO）联系在一起。	Some people also associate this "object" in Alaska with a "unidentified flying object" (UFO).	no
美国新闻周刊的报道引用美国前众议员彼得·梅杰（Peter Meijer）周五在推特上发出的推文说，“真希望这个‘不明飞行物’也是一个间谍气球，而不是一个合法的UFO”。	U.S. Newsweek report quoted former U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer as tweeting on Friday, "Wish this'UFO' was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO ."	no
“将外星飞船与气象气球混为一谈的讽刺意味很令人惊讶，但这不值得引发一场星际冲突，”梅杰说。	"The irony of conflating an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth sparking an interstellar conflict, "Major said.	no
梅杰是在科比证实阿拉斯加的这个物体被击落之后不久发出这个推文的。	Major's tweet came shortly after Bryant confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.	no
新闻周刊说，怀疑这个物体是UFO的不止是梅杰一人。	Major was not alone in suspecting the object was a UFO, Newsweek said.	no

但店家还是不错的，积极配合催促快递及时退款，但是这个全峰快递实在的工作是做的相当让人愤怒，拖拉半个月左右才退款，这种合作伙伴是要拖亚马逊的后腿的，工作效率差，没有服务意识！	But the store is still good, actively cooperating with urging the express to refund in time, but the real work of Quanfeng Express is quite infuriating, and the refund is delayed for about half a month. This kind of partner is to hold back Amazon. Poor work efficiency and no sense of service!	yes

第一次亚马逊用的合作的天天烂快递，第一次送货没在家，后来主动和快递员约了两次送货时间，那个快递员都不送，后来直接给我退货了，这个该死的快递员一点诚信也没有，强烈建议不要再用那个天天烂快递了。	It was the first time that Amazon used the cooperative Tiantianba Express. The first delivery was not at home. Later, I took the initiative to make two delivery appointments with the courier. The courier refused to deliver, and then returned it directly to me. The courier has no integrity at all, and it is strongly recommended not to use that bad courier any more.	yes
这一次还有一件体恤衫也给我退货了，再拍也涨价了一百多元。	This time, I also returned a t-shirt, and the price was increased by more than 100 yuan.	yes

我申请退货，厂家的人看到图片后说是运输导致，这不是瞎说吗？	I applied to return the product, and the people from the manufacturer saw the picture and said it was caused by transportation. Isn't this nonsense?	yes
商品内部怎么可能磨损？	How can an item be worn down inside?	yes
只有两种可能，要么次品旧品，要么就是我故意损坏商品，然后拿去退货。	There are only two possibilities, either it is a defective product, or I damaged the product on purpose and then returned it.	yes
客观来讲，我没有证据证明我没有损坏商品，但是以我在亚马逊购物的信用记录来讲，我认为这样的商品不应该出现在亚马逊自营商品中，客户选择亚马逊自营就是信任，customer win，we win，客户的胜利就是厂商的胜利，希望大家一起努力改进，谢谢。	Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the product, but based on my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I think such products should not appear in Amazon's self-operated products. Customers who choose Amazon's self-operated products are trust, customer win, we win, the customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory, I hope everyone will work hard to improve, thank you.	yes
我使用该产品不到一年，就出现两个E2，我不知道如何处理?	I have been using this product for less than a year, and there are two E2s, I don't know how to deal with it?	yes
我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?	I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, red E2 appeared on the two groups on the right side of the receiver. It should be a problem with the transmitter module. This is consistent with the continuous work of the transmitter module mentioned on the Amazon website. 7 years does not quite match, and I can't find after-sales service on the Amazon website, so I don't know what to do now?	yes
还行吧	Okay	yes

不足就是没有卡，自己买的，还有就是以前在亚马逊买过手机。	The disadvantage is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I bought a mobile phone from Amazon before.	yes
包装上会有贴纸，防止包装被打开，这次没有，买手机时候还有个贴纸一样的章，可以贴在保修卡上，这次没有。	There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened. Not this time. When buying a mobile phone, there is a sticker like a chapter that can be attached to the warranty card. Not this time.	yes

日本亚马逊因为客服问题导致买家的利益严重受损（8c的毛毛虫发货为8cm的毛毛虫）（8c=14cm，8cm=2c）	Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service problems (8c caterpillars are shipped as 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)	yes
承认错误，但是一直在推诿，始终强调货物为第三方，不能约束第三方。	Admitting mistakes, but always evading, always emphasizing that the goods are a third party, and the third party cannot be restrained.	yes
订单编号：503-4265464-1830254。	Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.	yes
我当初购买的页面尺码选项为7c，8，9c，当时觉得这就是个陷阱，打电话给日亚中文客服，明确告知8就是8c，但是等商品回到中国才发现，只有8cm，我觉得这完全是故意设下的陷阱来坑中国人（按照亚马逊的售后），现在查看页面已没有这个选项。	The page size options I bought at the beginning were 7c, 8, and 9c. At that time, I thought it was a trap. I called Nichia's Chinese customer service and told me that 8 was 8c, but I found out that it was only 8cm when the product returned to China. I think this is completely a trap deliberately set to trap Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service), and now there is no such option on the viewing page.	yes
中方客服：很抱歉，给你带来损失了，我们给你两条路走：	Chinese customer service: Sorry for the loss, we give you two ways:	yes
1，你退货，买家承担所有运费。	1. You return the product, and the buyer bears all shipping costs.	yes
2，你不退货，我们补偿你1000日元。	2. If you do not return the product, we will compensate you 1,000 yen.	yes
（我算一下账，鞋子4000多日元，算作200rmb，选择1，我没有鞋子，损失在200元。	(Let me do the math, the shoes cost more than 4,000 yen, which counts as 200rmb, choose 1, I don't have shoes, and the loss is 200 yuan.	yes
选择2，我有鞋子，最后补偿了我2000日元，最后损失在150rmb 客服：我们已记录下来，我们会认真处理，次日回了封邮件，说我不接受中方客服调解，就这么完了。	Choice 2, I have shoes, and finally compensated me 2,000 yen, and the final loss was 150rmb. Customer service: We have recorded it, and we will deal with it seriously. The next day, I replied an email, saying that I would not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service, and it was over.	yes
我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	I proposed: when the purchase page has confusing options such as 7c, 8, and 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me tell me that Japanese common codes do not include c, similar to 140, but you guys have gone to other caterpillar pages to see it?	yes
都有美码，日码混标的情况出现。	There is a mix of US and Japanese sizes.	no
再说，你8cm为什么放在7c和9c中间，明明最小的尺码，你放那里算什么意思。	Besides, why do you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, it is obviously the smallest size, what do you mean by putting it there.	no
中方客服：我们提供中文服务，但是不知道你要运回国，所以你的运费我们是不予理赔的。	Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know that you are going to ship it back to your country, so we will not compensate for your shipping cost.	no
这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	I don't understand this logic again. I'm Japanese, and I still need Chinese customer service. China living in Japan doesn't need Chinese customer service. Visitors to Japan don't have the skills to make international long distance calls. Then the question arises, who needs to call Amazon's overseas purchases of Chinese phones are nothing more than day-to-day shopping like me.	no
亚马逊中文客服不就是方便了我们海淘的这些人吗？	Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just convenient for those of us overseas shopping?	no
这次购买不是很满意	Not very satisfied with this purchase	yes
这是第二次从亚马逊上购买帮宝适尿布，曾经在宝宝2个月的时候买过一箱，选择了欧洲进口纸张的尿布，第一次购买经历还是比较满意的，宝宝整夜就用一张尿布，的确可以满足12个小时不换尿布。	This is the second time I bought Pampers diapers from Amazon. I bought a box of diapers when my baby was 2 months old. I chose diapers made of paper imported from Europe. I was quite satisfied with the first purchase experience. The baby used them all night One diaper can indeed satisfy 12 hours without changing diapers.	yes
但是这次购买L号的尿布，一箱里面有2包分开包装，打开后就觉得纸张比较松，跟进口帮宝适有明显区别，给宝宝用了之后，还算可以，没有漏尿也没有红疹等迹象。	But this time I bought L size diapers, there are 2 packs in a box and they are packed separately. After opening, I feel that the paper is loose, which is obviously different from imported Pampers. After using it for the baby, it is okay, there is no leakage of urine, no rash and other signs.	yes
但是到了第二包尿布，开始使用后宝宝的大腿内侧立马就出现了红疹，至今还没有褪去。	But when it came to the second pack of diapers, a rash appeared on the inner thighs of the baby immediately after using it, and it hasn't faded yet.	yes
怀疑1箱里面的2包，质量还不一样啊。	I suspect that the quality of the 2 packages in 1 box is not the same.	yes
以后应该不会继续购买了！	Should not continue to buy in the future!	yes
希望重视包裹的运输保护	Hope to pay attention to the transportation protection of the package	yes
这是我网购这么久以来，看到最差的一次包装运输，完全没有什么保护措施，缓冲泡沫，包裹缓冲层材料等，什么都没有。	This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen since I have been shopping online for a long time. There are no protective measures at all, such as cushioning foam, wrapping cushioning layer materials, etc., nothing.	yes
就一个压变形的箱子。	Just a deformed box.	yes
而且里面的软胶盒包装的，卡盒都压开了压到变形了。	Moreover, the soft plastic box inside was packed, and the card box was pressed open and deformed.	yes
希望是正品 质量有保证，以后是不怎么敢亚马孙买东西的了。	I hope it is genuine and the quality is guaranteed. I will not dare to buy things from Amazon in the future.	yes
宁愿国内贵一半，有保障点。	I would rather be half as expensive in China and have a guarantee.	yes
而且商品产品包装问题，我看评论2016年就有人评论过，到现在19年，还是老样子。	And the product packaging problem, I read the comments in 2016, someone commented on it, and it is still the same in 19 years.	yes
说明亚马逊根本就不重视服务反馈这一块，和国内的京东、天猫等差太远了。	It shows that Amazon does not pay attention to service feedback at all, and it is far behind domestic JD.com and Tmall.	yes
好看，但有点点小遗憾	Beautiful, but a little sad	yes
整个杯子的颜色是我狠喜欢的，橘红色，虽然我家是男宝，但是还是觉得橘红配黄色很亮眼。	I really like the color of the whole cup, orange-red. Although my family is a boy, I still think orange-red and yellow are very eye-catching.	yes
比我想象的小一些，不过本来就是拿来带出门用的，所以还可以接受。	It's smaller than I thought, but it's meant to be taken out, so it's acceptable.	yes
昨晚拿回家试了一下，瓶盖推开之后，吸管和盖子之间的距离太近了，因为吸管的位置是正向垂直的，所以儿子总是要把盖子上面的凸起含住喝水，觉得这个地方是否可以改进一下。	I took it home and tried it last night. After the bottle cap was pushed off, the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the position of the straw is vertical, my son always had to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water. I think this place can be improved.	yes
看来其他牌子的吸管杯把吸管做的倾斜还是有道理的，小孩子的东西，真的就是在乎安全和舒适。	It seems that it makes sense for other brands of straw cups to tilt the straw. Children's things really care about safety and comfort.	yes
轻便大容量	Portable and large capacity	yes
喜欢它轻便，开口大，就是两个独立的分隔袋对我来说有点多余，感觉不知道装什么好。	I like that it is light and has a large opening, but two separate compartments are a bit redundant for me, and I don't know what to pack.	yes
买完发现海外购美亚上还有一只另一个牌子很类似的，才不到两百块。	After buying it, I found that there is another brand that is very similar on Overseas Buy Meiya, and it is less than 200 yuan.	yes
假货，假的特别厉害	Fake, fake is very powerful	yes
亚马逊卖假货，我也是服了。	Amazon sells fakes, and I'm convinced too.	yes
客服说因为用了所以不能退货，我没用怎么知道是假货。	The customer service said that the product cannot be returned because it has been used. How can I know it is a fake if it is useless?	yes
因为信任，所以伤心，毕竟是抹脸的用品，真的去实体店买吧，认可贵一点。	Because of trust, I am sad. After all, it is a product for wiping your face. You should really go to a physical store to buy it. It is admitted that it is more expensive.	yes
因为是秒杀，所以没有看评论，我已经提交国家工商总局的电商平台了，我们一起维权吧。	Because it is a spike, so I didn't read the comments. I have submitted it to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let's defend our rights together.	yes
坏了？	broken?	yes
假货？	Fake?	yes
总之悲剧。	All in all tragic.	yes
用第二片的时候选的毛孔细致的，但是一打开就一股怪味，以为是正常的，因为没用过这款，然后往脸上贴的时候就整个受不了了，非常冲的味道，无法形容，熏到立马咳嗽了出来，眼睛也很痛，流眼泪，马上摘了去洗脸。	When I used the second piece, the pores were fine, but when I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal, because I hadn't used this one before, and then I couldn't stand it when I put it on my face. It smells very strong, indescribable, so smoked that I immediately coughed out, my eyes hurt, and tears flowed, so I took it off immediately to wash my face.	yes
不信邪又开了一片同款的，没有那么重的味道了，现在正在敷。	Buxinxie opened another slice of the same type, it doesn't have such a strong smell, and it's being applied now.	yes
回想起有点像发廊里劣质烫发水的味道。	In retrospect, it kind of smells like bad perm water in the hair salon.	yes
真无法想象，难倒亚马逊自营的护肤品从此也得避而远之了吗？	It's really unimaginable, is it difficult for Amazon's self-operated skin care products to be avoided from now on?	yes
奸商啊	profiteer	yes
当时购买的时候，活动页面上是说满99元赠送“三体全集”，收到货没有这个赠品，打客服电话说要给他们看当时活动的截图，问题是谁买东西还把网页截图保存啊，你们自己做过的活动，还需要顾客帮你们提供啊，各位买家下次要留个心眼，保存证据。	When I bought it, the event page said that I would give away the "Complete Works of Three-Body" when I spent 99 yuan. When I received the goods, I didn't have this gift. I called customer service and said that I would show them the screenshots of the event at that time. The question is who bought the things and saved the screenshots of the webpage. You need customers to provide you with the activities you have done yourself. Buyers should be careful next time and keep the evidence.	yes
用后感受	Feeling after use	yes
第一次在亚马逊买东西，分别感受有几点，先来说下用完商品的感受吧，第一确实是无痛，也没有刺激味道的东西，总体来说很不错的，静等8分钟左右一擦就掉了，只是会有少量的汗毛渣在上面，不细看是看不出来的，所以说总体是不错的，至于之后都就用一次还要继续观察，继续用才会知道。	This is the first time I bought something on Amazon. I have a few points of experience. Let's talk about the feeling of using up the product first. The first thing is that it is painless and has no irritating taste. Overall it is very good. Wait for 8 minutes or so and it will fall off after wiping, but there will be a small amount of hair residue on it, which can't be seen unless you look closely, so overall it is good, as for after using it once, you need to continue to observe, and you will know if you continue to use it.	yes
反正我觉得这个东西确实不错。	Anyway, I think this thing is really good.	yes
第二从27号下单，12号收到货，总共15天也就是半个月，亚马逊的送货员服务态度也很好。	The second is to place an order on the 27th and receive the goods on the 12th, a total of 15 days, which is half a month, and the service attitude of Amazon's delivery staff is also very good.	yes
第三，亚马逊的什么黑色星期五就不要相信了，星期五下单，等了2天就便宜了接近12块钱，也就是我买成170多（加上运费什么的），有一种搞活动就提价格的感觉样。	Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday. If you place an order on Friday and wait for 2 days, it's nearly 12 yuan cheaper, which means I bought it for more than 170 (plus shipping).	yes
客服说什么价格波动，我关注了10多天价格也就是这个样，波动也不大的。	The customer service said that the price fluctuates. I have paid attention to the price for more than 10 days, and the price is like this, and the fluctuation is not big.	yes
价格实惠，日原产，有中文标签，带颗粒，绝对回购！	Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese label, with granules, definitely repurchase!	yes
膏体里带颗粒的，清爽感恰到好处，用后牙齿爽滑，上比某二手东强太多啦，那里说是进口的东西，可好多东西没有中文标签，不知从哪里批发的。	There are granules in the paste, the refreshing feeling is just right, and the teeth are smooth after use. It is much better than a second-hand product. It says that it is imported, but many things do not have Chinese labels. I don't know where they are wholesaled from.	yes
以后只要亚马逊有的，绝不再去二手东。	In the future, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to second-hand stores again.	yes
给个建议，亚马逊的app 上晒单怎么有时晒不了，希望能改进一些应用，会做的越来越好的！	Give me a suggestion, why sometimes the listing on Amazon's app can't be posted, I hope to improve some apps, and it will do better and better!	yes
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	Excellence has been getting worse and worse over the years, and there is no service quality at all!	yes
垃圾卓越不顾及客户需求 下订单的时候特别配送时间19:00-22:00。	Garbage Excellence does not consider customer needs. When placing an order, the special delivery time is 19:00-22:00.	yes
因家里有术后卧床不方便的老人在，所以只有晚上可以方便收件。	Because there are elderly people who are inconvenient to stay in bed after surgery, it is only convenient to receive the mail at night.	yes
结果竟然中午12点就直接上门送了，也不事先电话告知。	It turned out that it was delivered directly to the door at 12:00 noon, without calling in advance.	yes
如果配送时间是你们快递员随心所欲的想几点就几点送，何必假惺惺弄个时间让客户选择？	If the delivery time is that your courier can deliver it at any time he wants, why bother to make a time for the customer to choose?	yes
如果自己的物流没办法保证服务的，那就干脆不要做电商了！	If your own logistics can't guarantee the service, then don't do e-commerce at all!	yes
让一个身上3处伤口的老人下床开门收快递还要找零钱付费！	Let an old man with 3 wounds get out of bed and open the door to receive the courier, and he has to find change to pay!	yes

从头到底也没有人来电话联系一下给个解释！	From the beginning to the end, no one called to give an explanation!	yes
卓越网所谓的投诉客服就是一帮子外地人在那里装样子，敷衍你的投诉然后给你一个所谓的答复。	The so-called complaint customer service of Joyo.com is a group of outsiders pretending to be there, perfunctory your complaint and then give you a so-called answer.	yes
不会有任何改变或者补偿！	No change or compensation will be made!	no
之前也是遇到这样子了类似配送时间不对的问题也就忍了，但这次无法忍受，太过分了！	I have encountered problems like this before, and I can bear it like the wrong delivery time, but this time I can't bear it, it's too much!	no
新书买的预售到货后竟然封面和封底是反的，这样子明显得质量问题就这样子闭眼把书发给顾客了？	After the pre-sale of the new book arrived, the cover and the back cover were reversed, so there was an obvious quality problem, so you just closed your eyes and sent the book to the customer?	no
留言差评也不会有人来联系你。	Leave a bad comment and no one will contact you.	no
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	Excellence has been getting worse and worse over the years, and there is no service quality at all!	no
不会再在卓越上花一毛钱。	Won't spend a dime on excellence again.	no
图片质量实在不能接受	Picture quality is really unacceptable	yes
作为“古地图集”这样的标题，本书在图片的选择、排版、印刷上实在令人难以接受，有些图片甚至有马赛克，模糊到无法辨识。	As a title like "Ancient Atlas," the selection, typesetting, and printing of pictures in this book are really unacceptable. Some pictures even have mosaics, which are so blurred that they cannot be recognized.	yes
即便本书不是专业的地图册，即便是小画幅插图，也应该对得起目录中祖先留下来的洋洋大观的中古文献资料！	Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small-format illustration, it should be worthy of the magnificent medieval documents left by the ancestors in the catalog!	yes
（况且很多图片是可以从相关行业资源中获取清晰的原始文件的），用这样的图片来拼凑图书与不使用图片有何差别？	(Besides, many pictures can be obtained from relevant industry resources in clear original files.) What is the difference between using such pictures to piece together books and not using pictures?	yes
！我为这样的治学精神感到遗憾。	! I feel sorry for such a scholarly spirit.	yes
文字方面不予评价，方家各有分辨。	There is no comment on the text, each buyers has their own differences.	yes
整体2星。	Overall 2 stars.	yes
高二的时候看的这本书当时只是抱着无聊看看玩的心态，感觉这样的书自己应该不会沉迷吧，毕竟起点的网文以往还是不太吸引我的。	I read this book when I was a sophomore in high school. I just read and played with boredom. I feel that I should not be addicted to such a book. After all, the starting point's online articles were not very attractive to me in the past.	yes
然后...就掉坑里了。	Then...it fell into the pit.	yes
按着这个剧情来说，整本书都是比较轻松愉快的，前部分叶修还在网游里的时候，即使是公会之间勾心斗角，也因为往往被叶神狗血，搞得一点也不沉重。	According to this plot, the whole book is relatively relaxed and happy. In the first part, when Ye Xiu was still in the online game, even the intrigue between the guilds was not heavy at all because of Ye Xiu's blood.	yes
至于到了比赛的部分，写出了时代的变迁新旧交替的一点点心酸之感（可能是我多愁善感）。	As for the part about the competition, I wrote about the change of times and the alternation of old and new with a little bit of sadness (maybe I am sentimental).	yes
看整部书花了我高二许多学习时间，可是就是停不下来。	It took me a lot of study time in the second year of high school to read the whole book, but I just couldn't stop.	yes
全职对人物和感情线的描写让人十分惊艳，有的人物只是偶尔带过，也会给人留下很深的影响，像比较重点描写的角色叶修黄少天苏沐橙都有大量的粉丝，而不在写作中心的角色例如江波涛楚云秀等等也十分找人喜欢，在一个电竞的爽文中竟然让人找不到一个让人讨厌至极的人物，这是全职在人物描写上的成功。	Full-time's descriptions of characters and emotional lines are very amazing. Some characters are only brought in occasionally, and they will leave a deep impact on people. For example, the more focused characters Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Muhe have a large number of fans, while the characters that are not in the writing center, such as Jiang Botao, Chu Yunxiu, etc. are also very likable. In an e-sports cool article, people can't find a character that is extremely annoying. This is a full-time success in character description.	yes
而在感情线上，全职也没有一般网文所令人诟病的后宫佳丽三千万要么美女要么腐的毛病，全文所有人的感情，都有一个共同的地方就是他们喜欢着荣耀这个游戏，并且大都想要堂堂正正的胜利。	As for the emotional line, there is no such thing as the 30 million beauties in the harem that are criticized by ordinary online articles. They are either beautiful or corrupt. Everyone's feelings in the full text have one thing in common, that is, they like the game of glory, and most want to win with dignity.	yes
小计量有却没有什么大阴谋，每个人看上去都那么单纯可爱。	There are small measures but no big conspiracy, everyone looks so innocent and cute.	yes
这或许也是为什么全职没有什么令人讨厌的角色。	This may also be why there are no annoying roles full-time.	yes
全职的IP很大，也归功于此。	The full-time IP is huge, and it is also due to this.	yes
撇开网文这个文化现象不谈，全职不失为一本不错的书。	Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of online writing, full-time is still a good book.	no
多少他真的会给人提供一些热血，一点点感动。	How much he will really provide people with some blood and a little touch.	no
今年4月份全职要动漫化。	In April of this year, full-time anime will be made.	no
其实想要买齐这套书很久了，碍于永远钱包不够厚都没狠下心下手，然后想要买的时候就发现，tb上简直是假货猖獗，其实全职最近出了另一个版本，封面图吧我自己是蛮喜欢的，但还是打算先买老的版本，所以就在亚马逊上看了看，一次性买下来了一套。	In fact, I have been wanting to buy this set of books for a long time. Because my wallet is never thick enough, I didn't make up my mind to start. Then when I wanted to buy it, I found that fakes are rampant on tb. In fact, the full-time recently released another version, the cover picture. I really like it myself, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I checked on Amazon and bought a set at once.	no
接下来简单说一下货的情况。	Next, let's briefly talk about the situation of the goods.	no
●第四本的塑封没有，但书是新的。	●There is no plastic cover for the fourth book, but the book is new.	no
●第十七本塑封是在但是被打开了，书的质感也很奇怪感觉没有其他的硬。	●The seventeenth book is in the plastic package but was opened, the texture of the book is also very strange and it feels not as hard as others.	no
●第23本和第十七本情况一样，但是也比第十七本硬，但十分的旧。	●The 23rd book is the same as the 17th book, but it is also harder than the 17th book, but it is very old.	no
●个别几本书的出版社不同好像第23和17就是同一个出版社，和其他的不同。	●The publishers of individual books are different. It seems that the 23rd and 17th are the same publisher, which is different from the others.	no
●整体来讲还算满意，24本很大一箱，很满足。	●On the whole, it is quite satisfactory. There are 24 books in a large box, which is very satisfying.	no
落寞的小狮子	lonely little lion	yes
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Missing Piece" but it turned out that there are a lot of words!	yes
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	I read it three times before I finish reading this book to the children. A little lion who can shoot a gun, a little lion who loves to eat marshmallows.	yes
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	When I saw the plot of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urbanites can't accept the arrangement of being eaten by animals.	yes
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	In the end, this little lion who succeeded in human society lost himself. He is no longer a complete lion, nor is he a complete man.	yes
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	In the end, there was only the back of the little lion, and I don't know where he went.	yes
可能多年以后，这个小狮子的形象还留在长大了的小朋友的印象中，在某一天不经意的时候被想起，或许对她会有触动或是启发。	Maybe many years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the memory of the grown-up children, and if she is reminded of it inadvertently one day, it may touch or inspire her.	yes
性价比很高的作品集	Great value for money portfolio	yes
1、以前还不知道TASCHEN，最近买了不少他们的书，原因就是太强悍，不论是选题还是制作本身。	1. I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but recently I bought a lot of their books, the reason is that they are too powerful, whether it is the topic selection or the production itself.	yes
本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	There have been 3 versions of this work. The largest version is the same as the complete works of Michelangelo, which is close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the medium version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest. It also comes with a book box for two volumes.	yes
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	Personally, I think it is acceptable. First, the price is cheap, and more than 700 pages are divided into two volumes, which are easy to read as paperbacks. Second, it is different from Michelangelo's complete works, which mainly consist of paintings. Da Vinci's black and white manuscripts account for the majority. For readers with limited budgets and non-art majors, this edition is the most cost-effective for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.	yes
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	2. The explanation of the painting part is great, including composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the last supper), but I don't know if it's the printing or the size of the book. Some shadows are too deep, and the details can't be seen clearly. Pity.	yes
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer in content.	yes
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius, while the latter's breadth of research and achievements are not enough to be described as geniuses.	yes
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	If you could only understand half of Da Vinci by looking at the paintings before, you will be completely speechless after reading the manuscripts.	yes
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Garbage, whoever buys it will regret it!	yes
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	I never give bad reviews, this is really rubbish,  waste of money to buy, what, give me a reason!	yes
1.走时不准，突然变成1月1号，时间归零了。	1. The travel time is inaccurate, suddenly it becomes January 1st, and the time returns to zero.	yes
2.劣质皮带，都不是硅胶的，带了手腕过敏起泡。	2. Inferior belts are not made of silicone, and the wrists are allergic to blisters.	yes
3.经常连不上手机。	3. Often can not connect to the mobile phone.	yes
4.续航只有五天。	4. The battery life is only five days.	yes
5.睡眠检测不显示，时间是0。	5. The sleep detection is not displayed, and the time is 0.	yes
6.不防水。	6. Not waterproof.	yes
7.其他。	7. Others.	yes
物流太慢	Logistics is too slow	yes
显示10月16号到，结果21号才收到，差评！	It shows that it arrived on October 16th, but it was only received on the 21st, bad review!	yes
快递太差，亚马逊上买东西本来就慢，没想到会这么慢！	The delivery is too bad. Shopping on Amazon is already slow, but I didn't expect it to be so slow!	yes
总体满意	overall satisfaction	yes
之前一开始还担心相机的包装，这次还好，里面有充气包，相机三码一致，也能在官网注册，快门次数0，其余的就只能等时间检验了 。	I was worried about the packaging of the camera at the beginning, but this time it was okay, there is an inflatable bag inside, the three sizes of the camera are the same, and it can also be registered on the official website, the number of shutter times is 0, and the rest can only be tested by time.	yes
发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	The delivery speed is quite fast. I would like to complain about the courier guy here. The valuables are placed in the concierge, and they go fast. I can't open the box for inspection in front of him. I am really speechless about this.	yes
商家发货前做到了为客户着想:)	The merchant has done it for the sake of customers before delivery:)	yes
商家比较负责，专门打电话问所用相机的屏幕尺寸，确实替客户着想了。	The merchant is more responsible, calling specifically to ask about the screen size of the camera used, which is indeed for the sake of the customer.	yes
发货速度也快。	Delivery speed is also fast.	yes
金刚膜贴上去也挺合适和管用的。	The diamond film is also very suitable and effective.	yes
电池充不满	The battery is not fully charged	yes
机器确实不错，想问下怎么第一次充电起就充不满啊，充电指示灯一直红色	The machine is really good. I would like to ask why it is not fully charged after the first charge, and the charging indicator is always red.	yes
目前找不到亚马逊官方反馈渠道，所以只能在商品评价里反馈	At present, there is no official Amazon feedback channel, so I can only give feedback in product reviews.	yes
1. 在 3 月 29 号，通过预购途径使用 31 元购买了此书，显示 3 月 31 号会推送到设备上，此时亚马逊官网上还无法预览该书（因为还未发布）；	1. On March 29, I purchased the book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, and it shows that it will be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book cannot be previewed on Amazon's official website (because it has not yet been released);	yes
2. 3 月 31 号推送到设备上的书，内容是空白，只有敬请期待，而亚马逊上该书电子版降价到了 18 元；	2. The content of the book pushed to the device on March 31 is blank, just stay tuned, and the price of the electronic version of the book on Amazon has been reduced to 18 yuan;	yes
3. 这两天反复尝试将设备上的下载的空白的书进行删除，再次同步，都无法获取到包含实际内容的电子版《商业的本质》，但是看到亚马逊官网已经可以预览该书。	3. In the past two days, I have repeatedly tried to delete the downloaded blank book on the device and synchronize it again, but I cannot get the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" that contains the actual content, but I can see that the book can be previewed on Amazon's official website.	yes
目前我有几点感想	I have a few thoughts now.	yes
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	1. The price issue is actually not the most important thing. The key is how to replace the blank books on the kindle with books with actual content, instead of downloading them forever and saying "stay tuned"	yes
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	2. The pre-purchased book should not be bought again in the future. After all, if the ticket is skipped, and then download a book with empty content, the procedure seems very complicated;	yes
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	3. I hope that Amazon will provide a normal channel to provide feedback on such problems. When there are doubts about the download or use of e-books, there will be a place to give feedback (work orders and online customer service are both acceptable, and you can refer to Microsoft's official mall for how to do it.)	yes
不是很推荐阅读	Not very recommended reading	yes
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see Write some thoughts from memory.	yes
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	This book is not so much a collection of short stories as it is a collection of fragments about love in life.	yes
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The tone of this book is extremely flat, the kind of plain water, the choice of words and sentences pursues the ultimate simplicity, and the plot is as quiet and flat as a street in a summer afternoon.	yes
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Each short story is a sketch of a short period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.	yes
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	Finally, they were collected together and titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."	yes
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I think this collection of novels, and its title, is like a kind of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not only the joys and sorrows on the stage, the sea dryness and rocks in urban legends, and it is not just the glue between you and me. Not only the above should not be represented by the above, love is also a life as plain as water, boring day after day, there is also a loss of life, evasion of reality, and confusion of the future.	yes
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	As you read this book, you may have in your mind images of the arguing couples around you, the dull marriages of people you know, and unfulfilling relationships.	yes
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	That's why I don't recommend reading it, from an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are boring, unless your life is rough or sweet like living in a candy castle, you will feel strange when you have to read it, not weird and boring.	yes
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	In terms of depth of thought, the daily plots did not catch people's eyes or expand one's thinking and vision (this is different from Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the short clips did not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistake led to the failure of love?	yes
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?	no
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much sense whether you read it or not.	no
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and genre than storyline, which is also the reason for the relatively poor reading experience of this book.	no
适合粗读,不能细看。	Suitable for rough reading, not close reading.	yes
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	The logic of this book is good, but the content is not full enough.	yes
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	It explains what and why many sales theories are, but it is weak in how to do it. It just points out the direction but does not give specific methods.	yes
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	Plus, the book feels like a cobbled together piece.	yes
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	For example, there are both domestic and foreign; there are well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and unknown people.	yes
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	I don't know if it is a story compiled for the sake of example, but it will be more convincing if some cases experienced by the author are given.	yes
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	Change back and forth between customers and customers.	yes
标题上还是顾客,正文中就变成客户了。	The title is still a customer, but the text becomes a customer.	yes
电子书中还出现了错别字、标点符号缺失、编号错误的问题。	There were also typos, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering in the e-book.	yes
总之,这本书作为理论入门是个不错的选择,但对于已经从事销售工作想要提高销售水平的人就不太适用了。	In short, this book is a good choice as an introduction to theory, but it is not suitable for those who are already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales level.	yes
快速了解互联网金融的导读书	Quickly understand the guide book of Internet finance	yes
这本书很浅，可以说只是一个入门课，可以帮助大家快速了解互联网金融的全貌，但要深入了解，还是要按图索骥，自己去深挖。	This book is very shallow, it can be said that it is just an introductory course, which can help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but if you want to understand it in depth, you still have to follow the map and dig deep by yourself.	yes
且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	And the book was written earlier, and the later content of Alipay and WeChat's subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned. Today's third-party payment share is probably not as small as the book said.	yes
现在好多人外出吃饭都是带个手机就好，商家也因为银行流水太高的原因，弃用银联了。	Nowadays, many people just bring a mobile phone when they go out to eat, and merchants have abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank turnover.	yes
但还是非常感谢作者写出这本入门书，看得出作者起码有多年的金融观察经验，对国内外的金融发展史都十分熟悉，所以才能写成如此通俗易懂的内容。	But I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of experience in financial observation and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.	yes
写高大空很容易，难的是写的通俗易懂。	It's easy to write Gao Dakong, but the hard thing is to write it in an easy-to-understand manner.	yes
欣赏你，更想让你知道！	I appreciate you and want you to know more!	yes
决定一个人工作满意度的第一要素不是薪水高低，而是在工作中是否得到了足够重视和赏识。	The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether he has received enough attention and appreciation at work.	yes
根据马斯洛需求层次理论，在人的基本生存需要得到满足后，最迫切的就是心理需要的满足——希望被理解、被肯定、被赏识。	According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, after people's basic survival needs are satisfied, the most urgent thing is to satisfy their psychological needs - hoping to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.	yes
确实，对于国人来说，大部分是“爱你在心口难开”，即便是怀有爱、感激与赞赏也是默默放在心里不会说出来。	Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them are "I love you hard to express," even if they have love, gratitude and appreciation, they will keep it silently in their hearts and will not say it.	yes
作者在本书中阐述了五种赞赏的语言：肯定的言辞、精心时刻、服务的行为、称心的礼物、身体接触。	In this book, the author expounds five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, timeliness, acts of service, desirable gifts, and physical touch.	yes
我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	I think the important thing is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use these five languages from your heart to appreciate anytime, anywhere, and to be grateful to the people around you, whether it is family, friends or colleagues.	yes
其实越是亲密的人越需要赞赏和感恩，这样我们的生活才会变得更加美好。	In fact, the closer people are, the more they need appreciation and gratitude, so that our lives will become better.	yes
学会赞赏，企业也能在一定程度上挽留住人才，降低辞职率。	Learn to appreciate, and enterprises can also retain talents to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.	yes
感谢译者给我们带来了精彩的国外的思想和世界。	Thanks to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and worlds.	yes
由于中西方文化背景等原因，语言之间或多或少会存在差异，如果有机会能看到作者原版相信会收获更多。	Due to reasons such as Chinese and Western cultural backgrounds, there are more or less differences between languages. If you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, I believe you will gain more.	yes
再次谢谢作者和译者以及编辑们的辛勤劳动！	Thanks again to the authors, translators and editors for their hard work!	no
疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	Suspected counterfeit goods, please review strictly by Amazon	yes
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, no weight, not even as good as roadside stall products, no weight, no barcode, the ten-bag packaging is also loose, is not a characteristic of qualified products at all; is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, I have applied for a return; It is completely a quality problem; it is recommended that merchants keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods; supplement: I bought a heart-to-heart, 23 yuan/10 rolls in the supermarket, added a few comparison photos to further verify the fakeness of the product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference to avoid economic loss and further unhappiness!	yes
再度期望亚马逊能够一丝不苟，严把商品源头。	Once again, I hope that Amazon will be meticulous and strictly control the source of products.	yes
马马虎虎的产品，和期望有差距	So-so product, not as expected	yes
优点：	advantage:	yes
1. 大品牌，价格便宜。	1. Big brand, cheap price.	yes
优点2：电机和刀片都是PANASONIC保证的，使用起来也还OK，但是和我期望有差距。	Advantage 2: The motor and the blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and it is OK to use, but there is a gap between my expectations.	yes
缺点：	disadvantages:	yes
1. 充电没有指示灯，这个最基本你的电源指示都省下了，估计购买300元产品的客户，在松下PANASONIC的眼里，也是施舍，毫无尊重。	1. There is no indicator light for charging, which basically saves your power indicator. It is estimated that customers who buy products worth 300 yuan, in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC, are also charity and have no respect.	yes
2. 有强烈的异味 充电时候，哪怕仅仅充电10分钟，就可以闻到强烈的塑胶燃烧的那种味道。	2. There is a strong odor. When charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.	yes
办公室试用了1天，搞的全屋子都是这种塑胶味道。	I tried it in the office for 1 day, and the whole house smelled like plastic.	yes
和我之前用过的同价位的飞利浦PHILIPS相比，虽然多了个刀头，但是松下这款产品，质量真是对不起消费者了。	Compared with the PHILIPS of the same price I have used before, although there is an extra cutter head, the quality of this Panasonic product is really sorry for consumers.	yes
小包装	Small Package	yes
收到快递一看上面写着电商版就知道又掉坑里了，比超市买的小了好些，应该是M，跟商品介绍上面的图片包装不一样，所谓新版吧。	When I received the express delivery and saw the e-commerce version on it, I knew it had fallen into the pit again. It was smaller than the one bought in the supermarket. It should be M. The packaging is different from the picture on the product introduction. The so-called new version.	yes
三颗星是怪自己马虎没看清楚商品规格，你卖M码电商版我没意见，你货不对版是几个意思？	The three stars are because I was sloppy and didn't read the product specifications clearly. I have no problem with you selling the M-size e-commerce version. What does it mean that your product is not the right version?	yes
电商套路深，有时间还是去超市买了。	E-commerce routines are deep, so I still go to the supermarket to buy when I have time.	yes
就酱紫。	Just sauce purple.	yes
味道不喜欢	don't like the taste	yes
小孩很不喜欢牙膏的味道，每次都说辣，也许用别的词形容才更贴切，小孩的词库里暂时只有这个词。	The child doesn't like the taste of toothpaste very much, and always says it's spicy. Maybe it's more appropriate to use another word to describe it. For the time being, this word is the only word in the child's vocabulary.	yes
搞活动时候买的，很便宜，所以也不好意思给差评了，四星吧，不过不会再买了。	I bought it during an event and it was very cheap, so I'm too embarrassed to give a bad review, four stars, but I won't buy it again.	yes
正品哟 包装好	Authentic yo well packaged	yes
包装很完整，里面加了充气袋，没有网上评论的只有光秃秃一个产品的样子。	The packaging is very complete, with an air bag inside, and there are no online reviews, only a bare product.	yes
瓶子外包装上还有一层塑料膜像图片上描述的一样，快递也很快，拍下第二天就来了。	There is still a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle, as described in the picture, and the express delivery is also very fast, and it arrived the next day after taking the photo.	yes
是正品，只是没货了，不知道什么时候再上架。	It's genuine, but it's out of stock, and I don't know when it will be available again.	yes
糟心的一次购物体验	A bad shopping experience	yes
黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	I placed the order on Black Friday, but I waited for a long time and didn't receive it. When I checked later, the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues and they said they didn't sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said that the sender can initiate the inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. I finally figured out that the courier was mistakenly sent to someone else. After several rounds, I finally got the courier back. The outer packaging has been removed, and the product is still intact. I don't know if it was used.	yes
错误的配图	Wrong picture	yes
我以为自己能够收到图1这样的耳机，没想到却收到了图2这样的耳机，图物不一致也就算了，耳机左右声音大小不一又是什么意思？	I thought I could receive a headset like Figure 1, but unexpectedly I received a headset like Figure 2. It's fine if the pictures are inconsistent, but what does it mean that the volume of the left and right earphones is different?	yes
虽然名称都是一样的，但还是希望大家能够小心注意，另外还请亚马逊负责人及时更换正确的配图，万分感谢。	Although the names are the same, I still hope that everyone can pay attention to it. In addition, I also ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct picture in time. Thank you very much.	yes
操作系统一般般	general operating system	yes
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	After using it for a period of time, overall the picture is not bad, I can't feel any difference, but this system makes people look tangled, the boot time is obviously a bit slow, and I can't make good settings, and the software I bring is not necessary. The response speed is even more general, which is not an order of magnitude compared with that of my colleagues.	yes
看评论说很人性化的设计，我没有找到哪里人性化，遥控器这个常用的上下左右，返回键设计的位置实在是不敢恭维。	I read comments that it is very user-friendly design, but I didn't find any human-friendly design. The commonly used remote control is up, down, left, right, and the position of the back button design is really not flattering.	yes
所以呢，就当个电视吧，再外加电视盒之类的用吧。	So, just use it as a TV, and use it with a TV box and the like.	yes
降价太厉害了	The price cut is too big	yes
降价太厉害了，一百多入现在99！	The price cut is too big, more than 100 yuan is now 99!	yes
在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	I have accumulated a lot of unevaluated orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the evaluation content.	yes
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I use this passage to evaluate, it means that this product has at least 85 points or more.	yes
而比较差的产品，我绝对不会偷懒到复制粘贴评价，这样其他消费者在购买的时候会作为参考，而商家也会因此改进商品质量。	For poorer products, I will never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers will use them as a reference when buying, and the merchant will improve the quality of the product accordingly.	yes
低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	Low price, good cable, no fever, that's enough!	yes
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	Such a cheap cable, but it should have reached the hdmi certification standard. Compared with the domestic Akihabara bullshit (the price is twice as expensive), the cable body is thick and soft, and the 7-meter transmission has no noise. Look for the low price line in the future!	yes
东西还可以，但是亚马逊的售后服务真的比其他网站差太多了	Things are okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites	yes
下单后发现下错了，但是取消订单已经取消不了，网页联系在线客服一直显示错误链接，联系不上。	After placing the order, I found that I made a mistake, but I can't cancel the order. The webpage contact online customer service always shows the wrong link, and I can't get in touch.	yes
到货后送货员给我打电话，我说我不要了，想取消订单的没取消成功，派送员就拿回去了，说先给我签收上，让我申请退货。	After the delivery arrived, the delivery guy called me, and I said I don't want it anymore, but if I wanted to cancel the order, the delivery guy took it back, and said to sign for me first, and let me apply for a return.	yes
申请退货时才告知食品类一旦签收不能退货，没办法打电话给亚马逊客服，也是一样说法，签收不能退货。	When applying for a return, I was told that once the food is signed for, it cannot be returned, and there is no way to call Amazon customer service. The same is true, and the sign cannot be returned.	yes
我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I have bought items from JD.com and Suning that cannot be returned under the policy, including milk, diapers, etc. I contacted the customer service and they were refunded, and JD.com's diapers were too smelly after opening. I contacted the customer service and they still returned it. You can't do it when you reach Amazon.	yes
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it?	yes
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	Tell me that I can either accept it myself, or let the courier buy it by himself. It is not easy for the courier, so why should I let the courier pay for something that I didn't buy?	yes
行，我也不退了，我自己收下了，但是必须给你们的服务打1分	Okay, I will not refund, I accept it myself, but I have to give 1 point to your service	yes
劝大家不要白花钱	Advise everyone not to waste money	yes
首先满怀期待购买，觉得都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧，收到了以后看包装觉得还可以，个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感，吃到嘴里完全没有味道，寡淡无味，咬开来果肉一圈是暗黄色就是坏了那种，好坏参着卖的，能吃的也就不到三分之一，劝大家不要买，也不便宜，质量太差了！	First of all, I am looking forward to buying it. I think the Dole brand should not be too bad. After receiving it, I think the packaging is okay, and the size is not bad, but there is a box that is basically soft, which cannot be seen from the outside., to feel, tasteless in the mouth after eating, bland and tasteless, the flesh around the bite is dark yellow, that is the kind that is broken, good and bad are sold together, and less than one third of it can be eaten, advise everyone not to buy, it is not cheap, the quality is too bad!	yes
吃一堑长一智，以后再也不在电商买水果了！	Gain wisdom by eating a pit, and never buy fruit from e-commerce again!	yes
产品防伪标识在哪里	Where is the product anti-counterfeiting mark	yes
瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的，从外包装袋看，感觉蹂躏的程度让人揪心，毕竟是食物类的包装太简单了，而且还是属于国际购的，还有没看到什么明显的防伪标识标志，开瓶非常轻松，关键是盖内的一层蜂蜜直接从里面冒出来了，有开口几乎是没有什么粘连性，外国产品都是这样的吗？	The corner of the bottom of the bottle is severely dented, which should be caused by a strong impact. Judging from the outer packaging bag, the degree of ravages is worrying. After all, the food packaging is too simple, and it is still purchased internationally. Have you seen any obvious anti-counterfeiting signs? It is very easy to open the bottle. The key is that a layer of honey in the cap comes out directly. There is almost no adhesion when there is an opening. Are all foreign products like this?	yes
生在中国的我有点不理解了。	Being born in China, I don't understand.	yes
应该是正品吧？	It should be authentic, right?	yes
还有拍下时提示二十几号到，这个是14号收到的，我第一次在这里海外购，只是把自己的疑惑写下来，或许这都是正常的？	There is also a notification that it will arrive on the 20th when I took the photo. This one was received on the 14th. This is my first overseas purchase here. I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe this is normal?	yes
提货服务有待改进	Pickup service could be improved	yes
我一共买了5份提货券，在提取时，第一次预约提取3份，结果只寄过来2份，经过多方沟通才确认是漏发、答应后需补发；第二次预约，刚好赶上休息日，网站和微信均无提示需要在工作日预约，造成了不必要的恐慌，建议以后改善。	I bought a total of 5 delivery coupons. When I picked them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 coupons for the first time, but only 2 coupons were sent. After many communications, it was confirmed that they were missed and they needed to be reissued after I agreed. The second appointment was just in time. On the rest day, neither the website nor WeChat indicated the need to make an appointment on weekdays, which caused unnecessary panic. It is recommended to improve in the future.	yes
不错的购物	good shopping	yes
东西好评！	Good stuff!	yes
还是比较相信亚马逊自营的东西，现在海外购以后很方便，从国外买回来物流时间比国内也就多几天，不得不说亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的，比走转运要快很多，所以现在很多东西都在海外购上买。	I still believe in Amazon's self-operated products. Now it's very convenient to buy overseas, and the delivery time is only a few days longer than domestic ones. I have to say that Amazon's customs clearance capabilities for overseas purchases to China are still very strong, which is faster than transshipment. Much faster, so many things are now purchased overseas.	yes
希望国内商品的质量和价格能够更好一些，很多东西都是国内产的，但是出去转一圈买回来比在国内还便宜，希望改进。	I hope that the quality and price of domestic products can be better. Many things are domestically produced, but it is cheaper to buy them when you go out and buy them back home. I hope to improve.	yes
垃圾	Rubbish	yes
看到这样的包裹，试问大家:觉不觉得是路边的垃圾?	Seeing such a package, I would like to ask everyone: Do you think it is rubbish on the side of the road?	yes
一个塑料易碎的包装，就用一个塑料袋从所谓的德国发过来，这样的包装是负责的吗?	A plastic fragile package is sent from the so-called Germany in a plastic bag. Is such a package responsible?	yes
我看这样的包装是装垃圾一样的，购买这个产品，包装及其简陋，没有任何防止破损的措施，就一个简单的塑料袋包装，到手后，包裹完全变形了，里面的物品也有破损。	I think this kind of packaging is like packing garbage. When I bought this product, the packaging was extremely simple. There was no measure to prevent damage. It was just a simple plastic bag. When I got it, the package was completely deformed and the items inside were also damaged.	yes
如果我只是碰到一个这样的，我认了，买了几个都是这样子，找亚马逊客服，客服就说可以退，但运费垫付，然后运费以礼品卡的形式返回给我。	If I only come across one like this, I will recognize it and buy a few that are like this. I contacted Amazon customer service, and the customer service said that it can be refunded, but the shipping fee will be paid in advance, and then the shipping fee will be returned to me in the form of a gift card.	yes
我试问一下，我用现金支付运费，你们给我返礼品卡，这是要我自己买你们礼品卡就直说啊，还要自己把产品邮寄到德国仓库，这不是买个产品受罪啊!	Let me ask, I pay the shipping fee in cash, and you give me a gift card back. This means that I want to buy your gift card by myself, and I have to mail the product to the German warehouse. This is not a crime for buying a product!	yes
而我一直跟客服说，出现这样的问题是谁的责任，客服却半句不说是他们的责任，连半句责任都不敢担当，这样的售后服务还有什么保障呢? 一句话:认栽!但我估计我这个评价，亚马逊都不会给公布的机会，直接回删除!	And I have been telling the customer service that who is responsible for such a problem, but the customer service does not say a word is their responsibility, and dare not even take responsibility for a half sentence. What kind of guarantee is there for such after-sales service? Planted! But I guess my evaluation, Amazon will not give a chance to publish it, so I will delete it directly!	yes
质量很好5星，物流很差	The quality is very good 5 stars, the logistics is very poor	yes
1，质量很好，秒杀的，价格适中，物超所值。	1. The quality is very good, the price is moderate, and the price is excellent.	yes
2，结实、用料足、焊点牢固、表面处理得当、颜色很好。	2. Strong, sufficient materials, firm solder joints, proper surface treatment, and good color.	yes
3，物流是硬伤，3号下的单，11号到的。	3. The logistics is flawed. The order was placed on the 3rd and arrived on the 11th.	yes
4，如果亚马逊没有标注预计到货时间是2月7号，我或许会很满意。	4. If Amazon didn't mark the expected delivery date as February 7th, I might be very satisfied.	yes
5，但标注了预期到货时间，就相当于给用户一个承诺，当承诺无法兑现的时候，用户很难受。	5. But marking the expected arrival time is equivalent to giving the user a promise. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user will feel very uncomfortable.	yes
6，如果你没有给予承诺的把握，请不要做出承诺。	6. If you are not sure of making a promise, don't make a promise.	yes
7，实际上，我非常在意商家做出的承诺。	7. In fact, I am very concerned about the promises made by merchants.	yes
8，所以，我打了低分。	8, so, I scored low.	yes
金线会掉色	gold thread fades	yes
效果还是有的，但感觉是否明显，就看个人咯，或是心理作用。	The effect is still there, but whether the feeling is obvious or not depends on the individual or the psychological effect.	yes
有一点不太好的，就是金色的线，本来设计出来是觉得好看，但实际上，这个金线会掉色，往车上一放，如果拿动几次，手上，和车上，会有一些金粉。	One thing that is not so good is the gold thread. It was originally designed to look good, but in fact, the gold thread will fade. If you put it on the car, if you move it a few times, there will be some gold dust in your hands and on the car.	yes
希望产品可以改进。	Hope the product can be improved.	yes
这种方形的，也没啥装饰效果，就不要搞金线上去，掉下来在车上弄脏车还麻烦。	This kind of square shape has no decorative effect, so don't put gold wires on it, it will be troublesome if it falls off and stains the car.	yes
东西完好，速度可以，分2个包裹还不同包装	The items are in good condition and the speed is OK. They are divided into 2 packages and packaged differently.	yes
8天的速度蛮快的，但就是2件分了2个包裹，包装还不一样，明显一个防震太多了，厚纸板贴着，封了层塑料，外包装也方便拆，一个就国内的快递盒似的，放了几个缓冲气囊就算事了，感觉有点敷衍。	The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it is divided into 2 packages for 2 pieces, and the packaging is not the same. Obviously, one is too shockproof. It is stuck with thick cardboard and sealed with a layer of plastic. The outer packaging is also easy to disassemble. The other is domestic. It is like a courier box. It is okay to put a few cushioning airbags, which feels a bit perfunctory.	yes
雅兰床垫真心不错	Airland mattress is really good	yes
34CM的床垫不是一般的厚，不要床直接睡床垫都可以了。	The 34CM mattress is not so thick, you can just sleep on the mattress without the bed.	yes
质量很好，不管是正面还是背面，都挺软的，睡眠很舒服，躺在上面很快就睡着了。	The quality is very good, whether it is the front or the back, it is quite soft, the sleep is very comfortable, and I fell asleep quickly when lying on it.	yes
床垫收到后因为快递暴力运输有两处有些污渍，雅兰客服很负责，很有效率的联系解决了问题。	After receiving the mattress, there were two spots of stains due to violent express delivery. Airland customer service was very responsible and contacted and solved the problem efficiently.	yes
并不是自营商品，亚马逊无耻了	It's not a self-operated product, Amazon is shameless	yes
页面明确标注自营，实际上由供应商配送，售后由供应商负责，出问题自行联系供货商。	The page is clearly marked as self-operated. In fact, it is delivered by the supplier, and the supplier is responsible for the after-sales. If there is a problem, contact the supplier yourself.	yes
想取消订单，对不起，订单信息已传递给供应商，不能取消；想退换货，在亚马逊成功申请了退换货，对不起，没有人理你，需要自行联系供货商退货。	If you want to cancel the order, I'm sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier and cannot be canceled; if you want to return the product, you have successfully applied for a return on Amazon. Sorry, no one cares about you, you need to contact the supplier to return the product yourself.	yes
这尼玛哪门子自营商品。	What kind of self-operated product is this damn.	yes
商品不是亚马逊配送，售后亚马逊不承担，客服竟然说“我帮你联系供应商”，还声称就是自营，太无耻了，赤裸裸的不要脸，赤裸裸的对消费者进行欺诈！	The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not take responsibility for the after-sales service. The customer service even said "I will help you contact the supplier" and claimed that it is self-operated. It is shameless, shameless, and blatantly defrauding consumers!	yes
郁闷的体验	Depressed experience	yes
之前在别家网购的滤芯，过滤效果不错，28天结束之后再用多一两天也一样没有水垢。	The filter element I bought online from another store before has a good filtering effect. After 28 days, I use it for an extra day or two and there is no scale.	yes
由于一直以来在亚马逊购置的东西品质都可以，这次就想着在这边买，第一次在亚马逊买滤芯，感觉不太好，不但早早就开始有水垢，而且滤芯一直用到第28天，都会有悬浮的小黑碳粉，真不知道是继续用下去，还是直接扔了好，非常郁闷~	Since the quality of the things purchased on Amazon has been good, this time I thought about buying here. It is the first time to buy a filter element on Amazon. It feels not very good. Not only does it start to have scale early, but also the filter element will have small black toner suspended until the 28th day. I really don't know whether to continue to use it, or just throw it away, very depressed~	yes
没有想象的那么好	not as good as expected	yes
和我以往用过的插线板比较，外部做工一般，内部如何未拆开看，但愿如店家所描述，从使用方便性上看，每一独立单位是否通电缺少显示	Compared with the plug-in boards I have used in the past, the external workmanship is average, and the internals have not been disassembled. I hope it is as described by the store. From the perspective of ease of use, there is no indication of whether each independent unit is powered on.	yes
包装破损了，等时间来检验产品的质量。	The packaging is damaged, wait for time to check the quality of the product.	yes
外包装破损较严重，里面的包装盒似乎是新的，但是说明书好像不是新的，九月才装修，囤货中，希望到时候不会是坏的，请亚马逊解释一下为什么好几个顾客提到包装破损，你们却能安然处之，谢谢！	The outer packaging is seriously damaged, and the box inside seems to be new, but the manual does not seem to be new. It was only renovated in September, and the stock is in stock. I hope it will not be broken by then. Please explain why several customers mentioned it. The packaging is damaged, but you can deal with it safely, thank you!	yes
总体不错，有点小问题	Overall good, a little problem	yes
第一次购买滤水壶，看了几篇评价文章，感觉LAICA的性价比高些就选择了这个，收到货按说明书装好了滤芯，试用了一下，感觉总体不错，但是在倒水的时候好像原水会从壶嘴的地方与处理后的水混合（原水仓密封不太严）。	This is the first time I bought a water filter jug. After reading a few reviews, I felt that LAICA was more cost-effective, so I chose this one. I received the product and installed the filter element according to the instructions. I tried it, and it feels generally good, but it seems that the raw water will be mixed with the treated water from the spout (the raw water tank is not tightly sealed).	yes
用的时候一定要等所有水过滤完再倒出！	When using, be sure to wait for all the water to be filtered before pouring it out!	yes
图片不完整	incomplete picture	yes
图片没有拍出侧面的细节，侧面的细节跟主体的风格并不一致，有很大差别，这是其一；这个珠子是泰国产的，没有标明产地，这是其二；没有标明质地，这是其三；我在英国买的时候，分明每项各有盒子，这里只有一个简简单单的塑料袋，而且珠子上面没有任何的产品标志，我哪里判断得出是真是假。	The picture does not show the details of the side. The details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body. There is a big difference. This is one. This bead is made in Thailand, and there is no indication of the place of origin. This is the second. There is no indication of the texture. This is the third. When I bought it in the UK, it was clear that each item had its own box. There was only a simple plastic bag here, and there was no product logo on the beads. How could I judge whether it was true or not.	yes
购买要慎重哦，尤其是买香港出来的东西。	Be cautious when buying, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.	yes
亚马逊客服真烂	Amazon customer service sucks	yes
两天前下的订单，今天收到就发现降了40块钱，花了好多时间找到客服，客服说没法补差价，可以重买并退货。	I placed an order two days ago, and when I received it today, I found that the price was reduced by 40 yuan. It took me a lot of time to find the customer service, but the customer service said that I could not make up the difference, and I could re-buy and return the product.	yes
这种客户体验和服务比某宝某东真是差一万倍。	This kind of customer experience and service is really 10,000 times worse than that of a certain treasure.	yes
还行，作为新手来说，值得入手	It's okay, as a novice, it's worth starting	yes
品相过得去，和极品金刚没得比，之前看过商场那个价格，少说都好几百，我是第一次玩金刚，还行。	The quality is decent, not comparable to the best King Kong. I have seen the price in the mall before, at least several hundred. This is my first time playing King Kong, and it's okay.	yes
东西不错	something good	yes
东西着实不错，送女友的，只是中午我不在加拿快递的时候有些不愉快，物流公司直接放邮件寄存宝里并且没发取件的验证短信给我，害我跑了两趟。	The item is really good, I gave it to my girlfriend, but I was a little unhappy when I was not in Canada at noon to get the express delivery. The logistics company directly put the mail in the treasure and did not send me a verification text message for picking up the package, which caused me to run twice.	yes
不过宝贝确实不错。	But baby is really good.	yes
值得购买	worth buying	yes

我等了2个小时也没有等来那个专员的电话，期间我主动联系了亚马逊客服，并邮件发送了客服让她给我回电话。	I waited for 2 hours but did not get a call from the specialist. During this period, I took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service and sent an email to the customer service to ask her to call me back.	yes

5美国亚马逊的商品没有问题，海外购这种购物方式是好的，但是比对美亚的服务可就差远了。	5 There is no problem with the products of Amazon in the United States. The shopping method of overseas shopping is good, but the service compared to the United States and Asia is far worse.	yes
6对我来说我只能继续等待...	6 For me I just have to keep waiting...	yes
底不平	Uneven bottom	yes
因为看点评里说的都很好，所有对这款锅很有期待，拿到手的时候也很喜欢，很轻巧，但开锅的时候就发现问题了，锅底不是平的，中间突起来，周边凹下去，油都跑到周边了，特意买来的开锅大肥肉炸出好多油都没法覆盖中央区域，糊了，开锅都开不了，这样的构造估计没法正常煮菜。	Because the comments are very good, everyone is looking forward to this pot. I like it very much when I got it. It is very light, but when I opened the pot, I found a problem. The bottom of the pot is not flat, the middle is protrusive, the periphery is sunken, and the oil has gone to the periphery. The specially bought large fat meat in a pot is fried so much oil that it can't cover the central area.	yes
不知道是否我运气不好，刚好拿到个底子不平的锅，幸亏亚马逊提供一个月的退货服务，果断退了。	I don't know if I was unlucky and just got a pot with a bad foundation. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I returned it decisively.	yes

虽然看起来是一个很小的缝隙。	Although it looks like a small gap.	yes
但是可以说是把整个设计感都摧毁了。	But it can be said that the entire sense of design has been destroyed.	yes
有点心疼那个产品设计师。	I feel sorry for the product designer.	yes
看来美的的产品经理还没有能力去打造这样的水准的产品。	It seems that Midea's product managers are not yet able to create products of this level.	no
（对于售后小姐的回馈当然不能要求太高，但当我听到售后说道这款产品所有的个体都是这样的，不是只有我买的这件有问题时，她的不以为然和如实重负的情绪让我明白对美的也不能要求太高） 2019-7-7水泵故障出水量少，已经第二次维修，第一次维修后两周又坏了。	(Of course, I can't ask too much for the feedback from the after-sales lady, but when I heard the after-sales said that all individuals of this product are like this, not only the one I bought has problems, her disapproval and truthful emotions made me understand that you can't ask too much for Midea) On July 7, 2019, the water pump failed and the water output was small.

亚马逊说周年活动320大优惠，后来发现大家249,289,299都有，瞬间有种被欺骗感，但是去超市对比了一下依然比同价位各种杂牌划算多了，今后外出可随车携带。	Amazon said that there are 320 big discounts for the anniversary event. Later, I found that everyone had 249, 289, 299. I felt cheated instantly, but I went to the supermarket and compared it. It is still much more cost-effective than various miscellaneous brands at the same price. You can take it with you when you go out in the future.	yes

机器看着挺新，配件齐全，就是杯子放在底座上晃动的厉害，我都害怕开机杯子直接飞出去！	The machine looks quite new, with complete accessories, but the cup shakes so badly on the base that I am afraid that the cup will fly out when the machine is turned on!	yes
问了一个有5200的朋友，听他描述好像没有我的这个这么松。	I asked a friend who has 5200, and he described it as not as loose as mine.	yes

太小，没伞套，材质一般。	Too small, no umbrella cover, and the material is average.	yes
根本不是大号！	Not a queen size at all!	yes
第二把Totes，1.这把没有伞套 2.伞柄材质一般 3.明明写Large,实际上就是一人用的便捷雨伞,两个人用估计够呛。	The second Totes, 1. This one does not have an umbrella cover 2. The material of the umbrella handle is average. 3. It is clearly written as Large, but it is actually a convenient umbrella for one person. It is probably not enough for two people.	yes
反而之前在美亚买的那把能三个人用无压力。	On the contrary, the one I bought in Meiya before can be used by three people without any pressure.	yes
感觉不太好	not feeling well	yes
首先是箱子并不怎么结实，用加按一下就变形了，其次是背面设计的平放时防止箱面的ABS刮花并起不了作用，再次是箱子里面就是一块布包着、拉杆的地方凸显出来..等等，各种不满意，最后拉链有点不顺畅。	The first is that the box is not very strong, and it will be deformed when you press it. The second is that the rear design prevents the ABS on the box from scratching when it is placed flat.. Wait, all kinds of dissatisfaction, and finally the zipper is a bit not smooth.	yes
PS：轮子感觉确实挺好的	PS: The wheels feel really good	yes
还可以	Well enough	yes
优点：这款双肩包比较精致，看起来耐用。	Advantages: This backpack is more delicate and looks durable.	yes
缺点：卡片上的二维码扫不到（搞什么鬼），15.6寸的笔记本放不下（再长一点点行不行），这款双肩包拉链可以锁起来，却不为买家准备一把锁，不可谓服务至上。	Disadvantages: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook cannot fit (it can be a little longer), the zipper of this backpack can be locked, but there is no lock for the buyer, can not be described as service-oriented.	yes

标签粘性太差，不防水	The label is too sticky and not waterproof	yes
虽然蓝牙连接很方便，但是打印出来的内容不防水，而且表面没有覆膜；且标签粘性很差，用于线缆标签根本不行，非常容易掉下来，买来用于整理线缆的朋友需要注意一下了。	Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not covered; and the label is very sticky, it is not good for cable labels, and it is very easy to fall off.

先赞一下天天快递吧，航空件，超迅速，服务态度也很好！	Let's praise Tiantian Express first, the air mail is super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!	yes
一直在用925-25,非常棒，刚收到925-85，笔的质量没的说，样式也非常漂亮，之所以给四星是因为笔有点重，不适合快速写字，笔帽调节铅芯长度处有点晃动，个人意见：925-25要比85更顺手。	I have been using 925-25, which is very good. I just received 925-85. The quality of the pen is excellent, and the style is also very beautiful. The reason why I gave it four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy and not suitable for fast writing.

开始我以为是那首歌音效的缘故没有多想，可后来听了半天我才发现这个问题很严重，不光偏音，低音效果也没我之前那个听起来好了，还有些许杂音，是只有我买的这个紫色的有这个现象吗？还是现在耳机制造工艺确实不行了呢?	At first I thought it was the sound effect of the song and didn't think much about it, but after listening to it for a long time, I realized that the problem was very serious.

货还不错	The goods are not bad	yes
首先说一句刚买了几天就发现降价了，差评，本还算不错，性价比高，cpu和显卡足够应付主流网游和相当一部分大型单机了，散热非常好，但屏幕有点漏光(ips屏的通病)，音响质量不太好，硬盘不好(建议自己花点钱加个固态)，昨天拿去售后检测了一下硬件，没有任何问题，自带的win8.1不太好用，建议升级成10，卖家发货很快，各项询问回答的也很快，收到电脑第二天发票就到了，不错，可惜什么赠品都没有。	First of all, I just bought it a few days ago and found that the price has been reduced. Bad reviews, the book is not bad, and the price is high. The cpu and graphics card are enough for mainstream online games and quite a few large single machines. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a bit light leaking (ips screen common problems), the audio quality is not very good, the hard disk is not good (it is recommended to spend some money to add a solid state), I took it to the after-sales service yesterday to test the hardware, there is no problem, the built-in win8.1 is not very easy to use, it is recommended to upgrade to 10. The seller delivered the goods quickly, and answered all inquiries very quickly. The invoice arrived the next day after receiving the computer. Not bad, but unfortunately there are no gifts.	yes
(顺便提一句买键盘贴膜一定不要去某宝一家叫E酷数码中心的店买，发货慢质量差，产品有问题不退不换，老板还满嘴脏话，特别曝光一下)	(By the way, you must not go to a store called E Cool Digital Center in a certain treasure to buy keyboard film. The delivery is slow and the quality is poor. If there is a problem with the product, it will not be returned or exchanged. The boss is full of bad words. Let me expose it)	yes
东西很好，平台官僚依旧	Things are good, platform bureaucracy remains	yes
硬盘质量非常好，性价比绝对高，比香港买还便宜，不急着用和可以忍受物流的话绝对推荐购买。	The quality of the hard disk is very good, and the price/performance ratio is absolutely high. It is cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you are not in a hurry and can bear the logistics, it is definitely recommended to buy.	yes
但不得不说的是亚马逊平台之官僚依旧，与几年前我发誓绝对不用的时候没有改进，你永远查不到实际物流状况，信息永远是几个星期以后送到，永远不能投诉，就是这么官僚！	But what I have to say is that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same. It has not improved from when I swore I would never use it a few years ago. You will never find out the actual logistics status. The information will always be delivered after a few weeks, and you can never complain. That's it. bureaucracy!	yes
货收到几天了，物流信息还是10几天后你将会收到货！	It has been a few days since the goods were received, and the logistics information is still 10 days later, you will receive the goods!	yes
物流不省心	Logistics worry	yes

三百多的机器要一百多的税确实比较高，看现在再六百多心里平衡多了。	The tax of more than 100 for a machine of more than 300 is indeed relatively high. It seems that it is more balanced now that it is more than 600.	yes
收到的时候封口胶条状态看着就很不对，像是拆开过，赶紧先拍了照，果然一撕就开了，打开后里面的纸板还有损坏，担心是别人退的，还没到纪念日就赶紧先给老公试试了，结果机器一点电都没有，还好刀头里面没有胡渣，要不大老远的咋退啊！	When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape was very wrong, as if it had been disassembled, so I quickly took a photo, and sure enough, it opened as soon as it was torn off. After opening, the cardboard inside was still damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else. On the anniversary day, I hurriedly tried it on my husband, but the machine didn't have any electricity at all. Fortunately, there is no beard stubble in the cutter head, otherwise I will return it all the way!	yes
好不好用或者短期会不会有什么问题还未知，如前面的评价，缺货时发出的东西确实不靠谱！	It is unknown whether it will be easy to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term. Like the previous evaluation, the things sent out when they are out of stock are really unreliable!	yes
体验感中偏上水平	Moderate to upper level of experience	yes

上次买了两包，居然是两种不同的版本，本来包装上左下角的字是绿色的，结果有一包就不是，是白色的字，结果猫猫吃了就拉肚子了。	The last time I bought two packs, there were actually two different versions. Originally, the words on the lower left corner of the pack were green, but it turned out that one pack was not, and the words were white. As a result, the cat got diarrhea after eating it.	yes
是亚马逊的货源是假的，还是发货时被员工掉包，我确定不了。	I am not sure whether Amazon's source of goods is fake, or it was replaced by an employee during delivery.	yes

1.UN是clarks最舒服的系列，可惜这款太差了。	1. UN is the most comfortable series of clarks, but unfortunately this one is too bad.	yes
追加：今天对比了以前的UN系列鞋垫（鞋扔了垫留着用），材质比以前差了不少，弹性不如以前，透气也不如以前，就是假假的软。	Addition: Today, I compared the previous UN series insoles (throw away the shoes and keep the insoles), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it is fake and soft.	yes

鞋子颜色比图片好看很多，皮质感觉不错。	The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.	yes
鞋码稍大一点点，25脚长10.5宽拍的7.5W，上脚稍微有点宽松，不过平时就喜欢穿宽松一点，垫一双鞋垫刚好。	The shoe size is a little bigger, 25 feet long, 10.5 wide, and 7.5W. The upper foot is a little loose, but I usually like to wear looser shoes, and a pair of insoles are just right.	yes
其次，这个鞋子品控真的不敢恭维，一只鞋底胶有破损，另外一只鞋面有各种擦痕还有个针眼，鞋面与鞋底连接处胶条错位，明摆着的以次充好！	Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not flattering. One sole has damaged rubber, and the other has various scratches and a pinhole on the upper. The rubber strip at the connection between the upper and the sole is misplaced.	yes
有点后悔！	I regret it a little!	yes
做活动280块买到的，这个价格买到亚瑟士相当划算，当然看评论还有更低的价格。	I bought it for 280 yuan for the event. It is quite a bargain to buy ASICS at this price. Of course, there are lower prices in the reviews.	yes

压脚背	Press the instep	yes
首先鞋子做工很好，值这个价。	First of all, the workmanship of the shoes is very good, and it is worth the price.	yes
我的脚是很标准那种，跑鞋uk7.5,eu41.5,皮鞋uk6.5,亚马逊的爱步也买过几双，从来没有出现过不合脚，但是这双我参照评论，买大一号uk7,上脚后因为大了一码长度明显偏长，但因为鞋垫太厚，还是压脚背压的厉害，加上徒步鞋非常硬，导致上脚非常难受。	My feet are very standard, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, I have also bought a few pairs of Amazon's love step, and there has never been a problem, but this pair I refer to the reviews and buy a freshman size uk7, the length of the upper foot is obviously longer because it is one size larger, but because the insole is too thick, it still presses the instep very hard, and the hiking shoes are very hard, which makes the upper foot very uncomfortable.	yes
如果你的脚不是特别瘦那种，不推荐购买这款。	If your feet are not particularly thin, it is not recommended to buy this one.	yes
如果一定要买，换个鞋垫也能解决，但是原配鞋垫看起来很高级的样子，不用又可惜。	If you have to buy it, you can change the insole, but the original insole looks very high-end, so it's a pity not to use it.	yes

It's just wrapped in plastic wrap for a few layers. There's not even a packaging plastic bubble wrap inside. When you open it, all the parts are placed in an empty box. Fortunately, the quality of the toy is good and there are no broken parts. It's much smaller than imagined, because it is not equipped with a battery, and it often derails when pushing it by hand.

我联系厂家问手表在入库有核对时间吗?他们回复说“有”，既然有，那为啥时间相差那么多，那肯定是手表没有精确度，简单地说就是水货产品，不是我说的难听，看嘛，很明显的质量问题（数字显示不完全）都拿出来卖，是不是垃圾货。	I contacted the manufacturer to ask if there is a checking time for the watch when it is put into storage? They replied "yes." If there is, why is there such a big time difference? It must be that the watch has no precision. Simply put, it is a water product. It is not what I said.

很满意的手表	very satisfied watch	yes

On a whim, I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon. It was in stock, but it was not self-operated and there was no price increase (I was secretly happy). Since the non-self-operated delivery is relatively slow, the system shows that it is expected to be the latest delivery until September 27th.	yes
老婆没手机用难受死了，第二天一早6点多叫我在想想办法，后来上京东一看256G有货可以当天送到，只得立马再订购一台。	My wife was so uncomfortable without a mobile phone. The next morning at 6:00 a.m., I was asked to think about a solution.

好吧，我就耐心的等着，到了中午上手机一看，订单还在状态还处于未发货，就立马联系客服要求赶快取消订单，客服答复已经操作OK。	Well, I just waited patiently. When I checked my phone at noon, the order was still in the status and had not been delivered.

买来之后其他的都没什么问题，就是在软件连接的时候，怎么都连不上，我家是TP的路由器，上网查了之后发现好多人都有这个问题，弄了两个多小时，各种改路由器的设置，最后我用360WIFI作为媒介给弄好的，期间给小米客服打电话，他们对这个问题也没有什么解决方法，直接就让我联系亚马逊进行售后。	After I bought it, there were no problems with other things, but when the software was connected, I couldn't connect. My home is a TP router. After checking the Internet, I found that many people have this problem. After more than two hours, I made various changes.

During the period, I called Xiaomi customer service, and they didn't have any solution to this problem, so they asked me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.	yes
另外一点值得注意的就是我在网上看到用户的评论说，这个摄像头支持的存储卡最小是8G，存储容量更小的就不能识别，希望大家注意这点。	Another point worth noting is that I saw user comments on the Internet saying that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and the memory card with a smaller storage capacity cannot be recognized.

I was never willing to use a mobile phone worth more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate.

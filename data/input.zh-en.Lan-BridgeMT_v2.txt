.0 目标文件 (Object file)	.0 Object file	no
.a 归档库文件(Archive file)	.a Archive file	no
除非使用了 -cec，-s, 或 -E 选项(或者编译错误阻止了完整的过程),否则连接总是最后的步骤.	Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process), linking is always the last step.	no
在连接阶段中,所有对应于源程序的.e 文件，-1 库文件, 无法识别的文件名(包括指定的.o H 标文件和 .a 库文件)按命令行中的顺序传递给连接器选项 (OPTIONS)	During the linking phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, unrecognizable file names (including specified .o H tag files and .a library files) are passed to the linker options (OPTIONS) in the order of the command line.	no
选项必须分立给出 : de ' 完全不同于 `-d -r '.	Options must be given separately: de ' is completely different from `-d -r '.	no
大多数 ` -=E :和 `-W' 选项有两个相反的格式 : -fname 和 -fno-name (或 -Wname 和 -Wno- name).	Most ` -=E : and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno- name).	no
这里只列举不是默认选项的格式.	Only non-default option formats are listed here.	no
下面是所有选项的摘要, 按类型分组, 解释放在后面的章节中.	Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, with explanations in the following sections.	no
代码生成选项 (Code Generation Option)	Code Generation Option	yes
总体选项 (Overall Option)	Overall Option	yes
明确指出后面输入文件的语言为 language (而不是从文件名后绥得到的默认选择).	Explicitly specify the language of the following input file as language (instead of the default selection obtained from the file name suffix).	yes
这个选项应用于后面所有的输入文件, 直到遇着下一个 `-x' 选项 .language 的可选	This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option is encountered. The optional language	yes
关闭任何对语种的明确说明, 因此依据文件名后级处理后面的文件 RE AS E ` -x' 选项).	Turn off any explicit explanation of the language, so process the files after the file name suffix based on RE AS E `-x' option).	yes
如果只操作四个阶段( 预处理, 编译, 汇编, 连接)中的一部分, 可以使用 ` -x' 选项 (或文件名后 Ah) 告诉 geo 从哪里开始,用 `~-c' ，`-s' ,或 `-E' 选项告诉 geo 到哪里结束.注意,某些选项组合 (例如 ，`-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c 编译或汇编源文件, ETER. ERA ATI 缺省情况下， GCC 通过用 ` .o' 蔡换源文件名后级 ` .ec 标文件名. 可以使用-o 选项选择其他名字.GCC忽略 -ec 选项后面任何无法识别的输入文伯 -S F 何事情.	If you only operate part of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking), you can use the `-x' option (or file name suffix Ah) to tell geo where to start, and use the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note that some option combinations (such as `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC replaces the source file name suffix with `.o' and `.ec' tag file name. You can use the -o option to choose another name. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the -ec option -S F What's the matter.	yes
了的目标文件.	The target file is ready.	yes
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	Stop after compilation, do not assemble.	yes
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	Use pipes instead of temporary files between different stages of the compilation process, because those system assemblers cannot read data from pipes, GNU assemblers do not have this problem, assemblers can accept C "dialect": support ANSI standard C programs.	yes
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This will turn off some features in GNU Cc that are not compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as keywords such as unix and vax that indicate rare use of ANSI trigraph features, and despite the use of (note: all standard libraries are available in the hosted environment, the main function returns an int value, typical examples are almost all programs except the kernel. The corresponding freestanding environment does not have standard libraries, the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website)	yes
对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', handle it in C style --- that is, do not specify the number or type of parameters. (Only for C++).	no
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	Normally, such a function foo in C++ means that the parameters are empty.	no
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	The section list is deleted from here in an attempt to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.	no
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	See the NU c manual, we have deleted the details, so when the content is outdated, people will not HERI.	no
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option brings an additional effect, allowing assignment to this.	no
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	He and the `-Ethis-is-variable' option have the same effect.	no
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp tries to support some aspects of traditional Cc preprocessor.	no
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	Especially the content mentioned above about the preprocessor, but does not include other effects of the `-traditional' option.	no
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of `$' characters in identifiers (only for C++).	no
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	You can specify the `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of `$' symbols.	no
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	(GNU C++ allows `$' symbols by default on some target systems, but not all systems.)	no
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion from ant type to enumeration type (only for c++).	no
正常情况下 GNU C++ 允许从 enum 到 int 的转换,反之则不行.	Normally, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around.	no
-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	-fexternal-—templates generates smaller code for template declarations (only for c++), by generating only one copy at the place where they are defined for each template function.	no
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files using templates.	no
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', all template instances are of external type. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.	no
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	This can be achieved through typedef, which refers to each required instance.	no
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-external-templates' is used during compilation, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.	no
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All member functions (except constructors and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class they belong to.	no
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	This does not mean that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.	no
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it is called directly.	no
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch allows the second and third parameters of the conditional expression to be of different types.	no
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	The value of such an expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable allows assignment to this (only for c++).	no
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	After merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into c++, the assignable `this' seems outdated.	no
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	Therefore, by default, assigning to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.	no
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation valid through the `-fthis-is-variable' option.	no
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.	no
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Various machines have their own default char types. It could be either unsigned char or signed char.	no
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned char when depending on the sign of the data.	no
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	But many programs have been written to use just char, and they expect it to be a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine for writing the program).	no
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This option, and its opposite, make such programs work on the corresponding default values.	no
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.	no
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	If no `signed' or "unsigned' modifier is explicitly declared, these options are used to define signed bitfields or unsigned bitfields.	no
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	By default, bitfields are signed, because they inherit from basic integer types, such as int, which are signed. However, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bitfields are always unsigned.	no
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	-fwritable-strings stores string constants in the writable data segment, without special treatment.	no
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	This is for compatibility with some old programs, they think changing string constants is a very bad idea, the `-traditional' option has the same effect.	no

在过去二十年期间，发展中国家吸毒情况的增长速度远远快于发达国家。	Over the past twenty years, the growth rate of drug use in developing countries has far outpaced that in developed countries.	no
这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。	This to some extent reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.	no
青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。	Teenagers and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.	no
在2000-2018年期间，发展中国家这一年龄段的人口增长了16%,而发达国家这一年龄段的人口减少了10%。	Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while in developed countries it decreased by 10%.	no

无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。	Whether in developed or developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas.	no
吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。	Part of the reason for the overall increase in drug use is the large-scale movement of people from rural to urban areas - currently more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.	no
城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。	Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where the trend towards urbanization is more pronounced.	no
财富的增加与吸毒情况增多相联，但承受疾病负担最大的是最贫穷的人在世界范围内，发达国家的吸毒情况比发展中国家更为普遍。	Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the poorest. Globally, drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.	no

这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。	These patterns seem less common in wealthier social classes.	no
全球新冠肺炎危机造成的经济制约很可能会加剧包括吸毒者在内的最弱势群体的风险。	The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.	no
例如，劳动力市场的变化，如失业率上升，过去一直与吸毒情况的增加有关，而这场疫情己经迫使全球数千万人失业。	For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment rates, have always been associated with an increase in drug use, and this pandemic has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide to lose their jobs.	no
新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。	COVID-19 may lead to further expansion of the drug market. The pandemic may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illegal crop cultivation, either because of reduced control by national authorities or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the face of economic crisis.	no
新冠肺炎的相关限制措施导致空中和陆路交通减少，海上贩运可能已经因此而增加，海上的拦截风险低，而且比空中或陆路走私的数量更多。	The COVID-19 related restrictions have led to a reduction in air and land transport, and sea trafficking may have increased as a result, with lower interception risks at sea and larger quantities than air or land smuggling.	no

在2014年确定的新型精神活性物质种类总数中，类阿片新型精神活性物质仅占2%,但到2018年，这一数字己上升至9%。	In the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, new psychoactive opiates accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, this number had risen to 9%.	yes
类阿片新型精神活性物质中有许多是芬太尼的类似物，其药效和危害已得到证明，在北美导致了过量死亡事件，其他区域也有，但程度较轻。	Many of the new psychoactive opiates are fentanyl analogs, whose efficacy and harm have been proven, causing overdose deaths in North America and other regions, but to a lesser extent.	yes
在北美，芬太尼有的用作海洛因和其他毒品（包括可卡因和甲基苯丙胺）的掺杂剂，有的用来制造假冒的药用类阿片。	In North America, some fentanyl is used as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and some is used to manufacture counterfeit medicinal opiates.	yes
一些证据表明，欧洲也有注射新型精神活性物质兴奋剂的现象：一项对欧洲六个城市废弃注射器残留物的研宄发现，许多注射器都沾有产生兴奋作用的新型精神活性物质》	Some evidence suggests that there is also a phenomenon of injecting new psychoactive substance stimulants in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that produce stimulant effects.	yes
2新型精神活性物质的使用可能会逐渐牢固存在于弱势群体中	2 The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become entrenched in vulnerable groups	no
单一种类的新型精神活性物质几乎从未形成大的市场。	A single type of new psychoactive substance has almost never formed a large market.	no

有22个国家报告了监狱中使用新型精神活性物质的情况，其中大多数国家将合成大麻素确定为主要挑战。	22 countries have reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most countries identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.	no
对前体化学品的管制迫使制毒者进行创新最常作为前体用来合成苯丙胺、甲基苯丙胺和“摇头丸”等毒品的许多化学品已被置于国际管制之下。	Control of precursor chemicals forces drug manufacturers to innovate. Many chemicals used as precursors to synthesize amphetamines, methamphetamines, and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.	no
贩毒者和制毒者一直在寻找替代品一不仅有管制较松的物质，还有专门为规避管制而设计的化学品，即所谓的“特制前体”。	Drug traffickers and manufacturers are always looking for alternatives, not only substances with looser controls, but also chemicals specifically designed to evade control, the so-called "specially designed precursors".	no
旨在阻止新冠肺炎传播的限制性措施很可能使依赖前体化学品的制毒者受到进一步挤压。	Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug manufacturers who rely on precursor chemicals.	no
来自墨西哥的证据表明，这已经成为 现实：据报告，2020年3月，从东亚进口的甲基苯丙胺前体短缺促使墨西哥和美国的甲基苯丙胺价格上涨。	Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: according to reports, in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia prompted a rise in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.	no

阿富汗和伊拉克甲基苯丙胺市场增长	Methamphetamine market growth in Afghanistan and Iraq	no
早在2012年，对医院、监狱和其他机构人员的调查就已经揭示了甲基苯丙胺在伊拉克的重要性。	As early as 2012, surveys of hospital, prison, and other institutional staff had already revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.	no
结晶甲基苯丙胺已经成为“芬乃他林”和曲马多之外又一种令人担忧的主要药物。	Crystalline methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to "phenethylamine" and tramadol.	no
2015年的一项研宄进一步证实了这些发现，吸毒者表示大麻比“芬乃他林”或甲基苯丙胺更难获得。	A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users stating that cannabis was harder to obtain than "phenethylamine" or methamphetamine.	no
最近，伊拉克当局发现了多个甲基苯丙胺加工点，麻管局已对伪麻黄碱制剂的大批进口表示关切一甲基苯丙胺加工点将这些制剂用作前体。	Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered multiple methamphetamine processing points, and the Bureau of Narcotics has expressed concern about the large imports of pseudoephedrine preparations - methamphetamine processing points use these preparations as precursors.	no
在阿富汗，甲基苯丙胺制造似乎始于2014年。	In Afghanistan, methamphetamine production seems to have started in 2014.	no
自那时起，甲基苯丙胺的缉获量一直在稳步上升。	Since then, the amount of methamphetamine seized has been steadily increasing.	no
但2019年上半年的缉获量一^657公斤——与上一年相比大幅骤增。	But the amount seized in the first half of 2019 - 657 kilograms - was a sharp increase compared to the previous year.	no
在其他国家大量缉获了据认为源自阿富汗的甲基苯丙胺，这也表明该国的产量正在迅速上升。	Large seizures of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan in other countries also indicate that the country's production is rapidly increasing.	no
政策变化和变化趋势	Policy Changes and Trends	yes
非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域大多有大麻使用增多的趋势	Most jurisdictions where non-medical use of cannabis is legalized have seen an increase in cannabis use.	yes
加拿大、乌拉圭和美国的11个法域允许制造大麻产品供非医疗使用。	Canada, Uruguay, and 11 jurisdictions in the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.	yes
在其中多数法域，大麻使用自合法化以来有所增多，尽管在其他未将非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域也观察到了同样的趋势。	In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions where non-medical use of cannabis has not been legalized.	yes
在美国最早通过立法的两个州科罗拉多州和华盛顿州，成年人非医疗使用大麻的情况增加，特别是过去一个月以及每天或几乎每天使用的情况增多，自2012年起便已超过了全国平均水平。	In Colorado and Washington, the first two states in the United States to pass legislation, adult non-medical use of cannabis has increased, especially in the past month and daily or almost daily use, which has exceeded the national average since 2012.	yes
所有指标都显示，自2011年以来，乌拉圭的大麻使用情况有所增加，上月使用情况几乎翻了一番。	All indicators show that since 2011, cannabis use in Uruguay has increased, with last month's use almost doubling.	yes
这表明增加的主要原因是经常和频繁使用大麻。	This suggests that the main reason for the increase is frequent and regular use of cannabis.	yes
加拿大的短期数据也表明，2018年至2019年合法市场扩大的同时，使用量也在增加。	Short-term data from Canada also shows that as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage also increased.	yes
然而，2019年仍有40%的大麻使用者靠非法来源获得某些产品。	However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources.	yes
全球大麻药草缉获量暴跌的背后原因是大麻合法化？	Is the reason behind the global plunge in cannabis seizures the legalization of cannabis?	yes
2018年，全球大麻药草缉获量降至20年来的最低水平，这是因为北美的缉获量下降，在过去10年中下降了 84%。	In 2018, global cannabis seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a 84% decrease in North America over the past 10 years.	no
相比之下，同期世界其他地区的缉获量几乎翻了一番。缉获的模式表明，旨在放开大麻市场的政策在下降中发挥了关键作用。	In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world during the same period almost doubled. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.	no
对新型精神活性物质的监管似乎有遏制作用在国内对新型精神活性物质的监管效果仍然很难评估。	The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a deterrent effect, but it is still difficult to assess the effectiveness of domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances.	no
一些对新型精神活性物质采用不同监管制度的国家显示出不同的新型精神活性物质使用流行率。	Countries with different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of use.	no

大约50%在北美，40%在欧洲，还有2%在大洋洲。	About 50% in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.	no
这些国家的人口约占全球人口的12%。	The population of these countries accounts for about 12% of the global population.	no
据估计，低收入和中等收入国家的人口占全球人口的88%,但消费的药用类阿片却不到10%。	It is estimated that the population of low- and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but consumes less than 10% of medically available opioids.	no
获取药用类阿片的障碍与许多因素有关，包括立法、文化、卫生系统和处方做法。	Barriers to accessing opioids for medical use are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.	no
较贫穷的人患吸毒病症的风险更大2018年约有3,560万人患有吸毒病症。	Poorer people are at greater risk of drug addiction. In 2018, about 35.6 million people had drug addiction.	no
贫困、有限的教育和社会边缘化可能会增加吸毒病症风险，并加剧其后果。高收入国家的研宄证实了这一点，在这些研究中，个人不利的社会经济轨迹一不仅仅是他们在某一时间点的状况一也与吸毒病症风险有关。	Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug addiction and exacerbate its consequences. This has been confirmed by research in high-income countries, where individuals' adverse socioeconomic trajectories - not just their status at a given point in time - are associated with the risk of drug addiction.	no
吸毒病症还会加深社会经济劣势，进一步增加失业、贫困和无家可归的风险，从而助长劣势的恶性循环。这些结果也可能与刑事司法系统内的侮辱性态度和后果有关。	Drug addiction can also exacerbate socioeconomic disadvantages, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby fueling a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.	no
妇女、少数民族和移民、性取向多样化群体、因武装冲突或灾难而流离失所的人以及农村环境中的人也可能受到吸毒病症的过重影响，或者在获得治疗服务方面遇到问题。	Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, diverse sexual orientation groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural environments may also be disproportionately affected by drug addiction, or encounter problems in accessing treatment services.	no
根据估计因残疾和过早死亡而损失的健康寿命年数的残疾调整寿命年（DALY)指标，在过去10年中，有害的吸毒对范围更广的社会影响加重。	According to the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the loss of healthy life years due to disability and premature death, the harmful effects of drug use on a wider social impact have increased over the past 10 years.	no

毒品和暴力之间的关系错综复杂很难确定精神活性物质的使用和暴力之间的所有因果关系。	The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.	no
全球范围的有限数据表明，迷醉可能是杀人的一个重要因素。	Limited global data suggests that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.	no
但在暴力事件中，酒精的作用似乎比毒品更大。	However, in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a bigger role than drugs.	no
虽然吸毒可能会导致犯罪，但在某些情况下，这种联系可以部分归因于多种中介因素，如社会经济劣势以及由个人风险、家庭环境和同龄人影响造成的其他类型的逆境。	Although drug use can lead to crime, in some cases, this link can be partly attributed to various mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by individual risk, family environment, and peer influence.	no
贩毒和暴力之间的联系是多方面的。	The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.	no
如果已有稳定的犯罪结构，包括国际贩毒在内的大规模有组织犯罪活动有可能在无暴力的情况下实施。	If there is already a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, can potentially be carried out without violence.	no
短期内，暴力的存在和程度与其说取决于贩运的数量，不如说取决于造成有组织犯罪集团之间力量平衡不稳定的某些变化，例如非法市场规模的变化，知名罪犯的死亡或监禁，以及使一个集团弱于另一个集团的执法措施。	In the short term, the presence and degree of violence depend less on the amount of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of notorious criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.	no
最新趋势	Latest Trends	yes
吸毒大麻是最常用的物质，类阿片危害最大	Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, with opioids posing the greatest harm.	yes
据估计，2018年使用大麻的有 1.92 亿人，使之成为全球使用最多的毒品。	It is estimated that in 2018, 192 million people used marijuana, making it the most widely used drug globally.	yes
相比之下，2018年使用类阿片的有5,800万人。	In contrast, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.	yes
但阿片类药物的相关危害却因使用者较少而受到忽视。	However, the associated harms of opioid drugs are often overlooked due to fewer users.	yes
在2017年与吸毒病症有关的估计167,000例死亡中，有66%是这类物质造成的，在据信为吸毒导致的残疾或过早死亡而损失的2,100万年寿命中，有50%是这类物质造成的。	Of the estimated 167,000 drug-related deaths in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and of the 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death believed to be caused by drug use, 50% were caused by these substances.	yes
合成类阿片的非医疗使用加剧了公共卫生危机	Non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis.	yes
在西非、中部非洲和北非，加剧类阿片危机的是曲马多；在北美则是芬太尼。这两个区域在经济、人口统计数据或一般吸毒模式方面几乎没有共同点，但都在奋力抗击由容易获得且生产成本低的物质助长的类阿片危机。	In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Tramadol; in North America, it is Fentanyl. These two regions have little in common in terms of economy, demographic data, or general drug use patterns, but both are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and low-cost substances.	yes
在北美，芬太尼等合成类阿片的使用导致了20年来类阿片过量致死人数增加。	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids like fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.	yes
2018年，在美国登记的67,367例过量死亡中，有三分之二涉及芬太尼。	In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.	yes
加拿大也报告了类似的结果，只是数字较低。	Canada has also reported similar results, albeit with lower numbers.	no
芬太尼导致过量死亡的部分原因是非法药物市场上的芬太尼药效不可预测。	Part of the reason for fentanyl-related overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl on the illegal drug market.	no
在西非、中部非洲和北非，非医疗用途曲马多的市场已有大幅增长。	In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of Tramadol has seen significant growth.	no
在该区域，接受治疗的曲马多使用病症患者越来越多。	In this region, there are an increasing number of patients with Tramadol use disorders receiving treatment.	no
2017年，全球截获的曲马多数量显著增加，达到125吨以上的峰值。	In 2017, the global seizure of Tramadol significantly increased, reaching a peak of over 125 tons.	no
但2018年，在印度通过一项监管曲马多的新法律之后，全球缉获量降至32吨。	However, in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate Tramadol, the global seizure volume dropped to 32 tons.	no
促成这两地危机的是制造简单和生产成本低，此外还有对曲马多和许多芬太尼类似物或其前体缺乏国际监管。	The crises in these two places are driven by simple manufacturing and low production costs, as well as a lack of international regulation for Tramadol and many fentanyl-like substances or their precursors.	no
使这两地危机恶化的是这些物质在药品市场和非法市场上都有供应，因而更加难以发现和防止其滥用。	The crises in these two places are exacerbated by the fact that these substances are supplied in both the legal and illegal markets, making it even more difficult to detect and prevent their misuse.	no
兴奋剂使用不断增多	Stimulant use is on the rise	no
兴奋剂领域以可卡因和甲基苯丙胺为主，这两种物质在其主要市场的使用量都在上升。	The stimulant field is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are seeing increased use in their main markets.	no
2018年使用可卡因的约有1,900万人，因为可卡因在北美和西欧颇为流行。	In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as it is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.	no
同年使用苯丙胺的约有2,700万人，其中甲基苯丙胺是东南亚和北美使用最多的苯丙胺类兴奋剂。	In the same year, about 27 million people used amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.	no
根据所掌握的多数指标，20年来这两个区域甲基苯丙胺的使用一直在扩大。	According to most indicators available, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding over the past 20 years.	no
在一些市场上，可卡因和甲基苯丙胺可以共存，有时是相互替代，这样一种药物的使用量上升时另一种药物的使用量就下降，有时是同时增加和减少以满足同一市场的需求。	In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that when the use of one drug increases, the use of the other decreases, and sometimes both increase and decrease to meet the same market demand.	no
新冠肺炎使注射吸毒者的风险增高	COVID-19 increases the risk for injecting drug users	no
据估计，2018年注射吸毒的约有1,130万人，全球艾滋病毒感染约有10%是注射吸毒造成的。	It is estimated that in 2018, about 11.3 million people injected drugs, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drugs.	no
注射吸毒者感染艾滋病毒的超过100万人，患丙型肝炎的有550万人。	Over 1 million injecting drug users are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million have hepatitis C.	no
2017年，因吸毒死亡的约有 58.5万人，其中一半死于丙型肝炎引起的肝病，而注射吸毒者的丙型肝炎大多仍未得到治疗。	In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of whom died from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most injecting drug users with hepatitis C have not yet been treated.	no
5 新冠肺炎限制措施造成的类阿片短缺可能导致使用者代之以酒精或苯二氮类药物等更容易获得的物质，或者将类阿片与合成药物混合。	The shortage of opioids caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.	no
随着一些使用者改用注射或更频繁地注射，可能会出现更多有害的使用方式。	As some users switch to injecting or inject more frequently, more harmful methods of use may emerge.	no

欧盟峰会为难民政策争论，欧盟官员：接收过程步步瓶颈-中新网	EU Summit Argues Over Refugee Policy, EU Official: Bottlenecks at Every Step of the Reception Process - China News Network	yes
欧盟峰会为难民政策争吵不休，欧盟官员：接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈	EU Summit endlessly argues over refugee policy, EU official: there are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process	yes
【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	[Global Times special correspondent in Belgium, Niu Ruifei] According to a report by Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit that day, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, stated that EU leaders agreed to implement stricter policies on illegal immigration, making it easier to deport illegal immigrants.	yes
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	The report said that this move by the EU is a response to the growing concern about the problem of illegal immigration in Europe. Now, the core issue for the EU is that very few illegal immigrants can ultimately be deported.	yes
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	According to summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize a large amount of EU funds" to strengthen external borders through infrastructure and surveillance.	yes
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	However, the EU and its member states are endlessly arguing over issues such as the payment of fence costs.	yes
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	Von der Leyen repeatedly stated that EU funds will not pay for related costs.	yes
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	But some member states' diplomats said that if the EU could share part of the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external border, it would free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.	yes
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	The European Euractiv website stated that EU officials admit that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process. Limited reception capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states cannot prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in EU countries. The EU's refugee reception system is in a near "permanent crisis".	yes
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	According to estimates by the European Commission, the EU's Schengen countries received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half more than the previous year.	yes
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	At the same time, the EU recorded over 330,000 illegal entries last year.	no
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	Against this backdrop, the summit also reached an agreement on a "principle" that EU countries can deport illegal immigrants based on the court decision of another member state.	no
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	In addition, the report said that EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of safe countries", which will pave the way for the EU to formulate a common list.	no

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	"US Escalates 'Chip War', Severely Damaging Global Semiconductor Industry - China News Network	yes
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	Recently, the US has shown signs of escalating its "chip war" against China - first, under pressure from the US, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; then, foreign media reported that the US government is considering severing all ties between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order restricting US investment in sensitive Chinese tech industries... Shortly after the start of 2023, the US has been relentless in its efforts to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.	yes
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	In recent years, the US has never ceased its efforts to suppress China's "core" development, precisely suppressing the supply chain of China's semiconductor industry on one hand, and building a "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain alliance on the other, aiming to completely "shake off" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.	yes
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it's wooing South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or establishing a chip "quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, China, or establishing a semiconductor industry chain "small circle" through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia "quadrilateral mechanism" and "Indo-Pacific economic framework", the US is attempting to build a closed supply chain cycle dominated by the US by introducing politicized, camp-based, and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry, thereby making up for its shortcomings in chip manufacturing and maintaining its advantageous position in the global chip industry.	yes
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	However, the US's high-profile "core tactics" against China are also "hurting the enemy a thousand, self-harming eight hundred".	yes
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	Recently, the well-known US chip manufacturing equipment supplier Panlin Group announced that due to the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.	yes
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	The global lithography machine giant, ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands, recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to a rise in semiconductor prices.	yes
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	According to US media analysis, after the US government brutally suppressed China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies have been deeply affected, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, etc.	yes
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	The so-called US suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.	yes
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain has long been formed.	yes
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	According to professional estimates, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross national borders more than 70 times, reaching 100 days in total.	no
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially advanced process technology, and heavily relies on East Asia.	no
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	Even if the US strongly guides the advanced chip supply chain towards regional development dominated by the US "small circle", the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries are hard to change.	no
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The US's strong "reshaping" of the "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain has severely damaged the global semiconductor industry.	no
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the participation of all countries in the world.	no
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	In recent years, the US has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introduced the "Innovation and Competition Act", the "2022 US Competition Act", and the "Chip and Science Act", using technological hegemony to consolidate its own technological leading advantage; it has "carrot and stick" approach towards allies, enticing chip manufacturing companies such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to set up factories in the US, striving to ensure the US's global leadership in the chip field.	no
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	In the short term, the US has indeed caused trouble for China's chip industry and related industrial development, reaping real benefits.	no
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	But in the long run, the US's hysterical suppression has forced China's chip industry to continuously break through, causing it to lose the huge Chinese market, and will ultimately greatly weaken the innovation willingness and innovation ability of US tech companies, damaging the development of the global chip industry.	no

去年11月银保监会制定了《商业银行和理财公司个人养老金业务管理暂行办法 》 。	In November last year, the CBIRC formulated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies".	no
《办法》规定，参加人可以通过个人养老金资金账户购买个人养老储蓄、个人养老金理财产品、个人养老金保险产品、个人养老金公募基金产品等个人养老金产品。	The "Measures" stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public fund products and other personal pension products through personal pension fund accounts.	no

专业人士指出，投资者要根据产品特点和自己的风险承受能力进行选择。	Professionals pointed out that investors should choose according to the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.	no

健身行业应摆脱信任危机-中新网	Fitness Industry Should Overcome Trust Crisis - China News Network	yes
又一大型健身房“暴雷”？	Another large gym "explodes"?	yes
近日，知名健身机构中健健身会员维权问题引起社会关注。	Recently, the issue of member rights protection in Zhongjian Fitness, a well-known fitness organization, has attracted social attention.	yes
春节后不少会员发现自己所在门店没有正常营业，随后，关于该机构倒闭跑路的传闻引起会员恐慌，导致公安、人社部门介入。	After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the organization's bankruptcy and absconding caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of public security and human resources departments.	yes
最后，该机构相关负责人出面回应，承诺会努力保障好员工和会员的合法权益，风波才得以平息。	Finally, the relevant person in charge of the organization responded, promising to strive to protect the legal rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm was calmed.	yes
个别健身机构的部分门店出现经营问题，暂时关闭，消费者本可心平气和等待问题解决，为何不少会员的第一反应是“大事不妙”？	Some fitness organizations have operational problems in some of their stores, temporarily closed, consumers could have calmly waited for the problem to be solved, why was the first reaction of many members "something is wrong"?	yes
健身俱乐部会员维权风波背后，是行业信任危机的深层次问题。	Behind the storm of fitness club member rights protection is the deep-seated issue of industry trust crisis.	yes
国内传统健身房普遍采取预付费模式，“赚用户不来的钱”是其发展的底层逻辑。	Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a prepayment model, and "earning money from users who don't come" is the underlying logic of their development.	yes
通过预售会员卡获取现金流，不断开新店，看似能够循环往复，实则寅吃卯粮，无法形成稳定的盈利模式。	By pre-selling membership cards to obtain cash flow, constantly opening new stores, it seems to be able to cycle, but in fact, it is robbing Peter to pay Paul, unable to form a stable profit model.	yes
健身房跑路等行业负面信息频频传出，对消费者信心造成强烈冲击。	Negative industry information such as gym absconding is frequently reported, causing a strong impact on consumer confidence.	yes
从市场前景看，健身房当然算得上是一门有“钱途”的好生意。	From the market perspective, gyms are certainly a good business with "money prospects".	no
健身赛道虽然起起伏伏，但始终受到资本关注。	Although the fitness track has ups and downs, it has always attracted capital attention.	no
多项数据显示，文体消费等领域热度不断攀升，市场持续回暖。	Multiple data show that the heat in areas such as cultural and sports consumption continues to rise, and the market continues to recover.	no
具体到健身市场，随着居民生活水平稳步提高，健康生活理念深入人心，健身行业发展大有可为。	Specific to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the deepening of the concept of healthy living, there is much to be done in the development of the fitness industry.	no
形势越是趋好，行业越需重视发展质量。	The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.	no
然而，个别机构对消费复苏后的健身市场盲目乐观，刚从危机中走出来，又吹响开疆拓土的号角，把融资资金一股脑投入新店建设上。	However, some organizations are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumer recovery, just out of the crisis, and blow the horn of opening up new territories, and invest all the financing funds in the construction of new stores.	no
不可否认，这几年受疫情影响，不少机构退出，行业重新洗牌，有实力的企业此时选择性地加大收购力度、重新布局，未尝不是新机遇。	Admittedly, affected by the epidemic in recent years, many organizations have withdrawn, the industry has reshuffled, and powerful companies choose to increase their acquisition efforts and re-layout selectively, which is not a new opportunity.	no
但是，健身市场发展要想进入良性循环，迈上行稳致远的康庄大道，行业就必须改变传统模式，改变经营策略。	However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous cycle and embark on a stable and long-term path, the industry must change the traditional model and change the business strategy.	no
只有稳扎稳打，重新建立起消费者的信任度、安全感，才能真正赢得市场、赢得未来。	Only by being steady and steady, and re-establishing consumer trust and security, can we truly win the market and win the future.	no
相比大建新店抢占市场，健身行业当前更需要的是沉下心来优化服务，用高质量发展来稳住用户。	Compared with building new stores to seize the market, what the fitness industry currently needs more is to calm down and optimize services, and stabilize users with high-quality development.	no
首先，要靠服务留住用户。	First of all, we must rely on services to retain users.	no
健身房属于服务行业，其本质是坚持“用户导向”，要紧紧围绕用户需求，把经营重心放在服务提质升级上。	Gyms belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to "user orientation", to focus on user needs, and to focus on service quality upgrade.	no
其次，要靠数字化转型提升用户体验。	Secondly, we must rely on digital transformation to enhance user experience.	no
比如当下流行的互联网健身房模式，实现用户按次付费和场地自选。	For example, the currently popular Internet gym model, which allows users to pay per use and choose their own venue.	no
同时，身体数据、运动数据得以有效利用，还可以满足社交需求，实现从线上到线下完整的服务闭环。	At the same time, body data and exercise data can be effectively used, and social needs can also be met, achieving a complete service loop from online to offline.	no
没有私教推销，没有巨额年卡，用户对健身机构“跑路”的担忧降低了，信任感也就提升了。	Without personal trainer sales, no huge annual cards, users' worries about fitness organizations "running away" have been reduced, and trust has also increased.	no
另外，还要积极探索多元业态。	In addition, we must actively explore diversified formats.	no
如今，体育消费已经从单一服务走向场景消费，健身俱乐部有望成为消费新入口，围绕健身所需的运动补给和健身器械等周边产品或将成为新的盈利点，为消费者提供更丰富选择。	Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from single service to scene consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entrance for consumption. Sports supplements and fitness equipment needed for fitness and other peripheral products may become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.	no

“保价协议”条件可不少	There are not a few conditions for the "price guarantee agreement"	yes
这家位于江北新区的楼盘名为保利扬子萃云台，看房人孙先生告诉记者，他在上周末逛楼盘时发现了一则“声明”。	This real estate project located in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai. Mr. Sun, a house viewer, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he visited the real estate project last weekend.	yes
他发给记者的图片上显示，该楼盘的开发商承诺，凡是在2月1日-2月28日期间购买房源的，自双方签订买卖合同之日起至对应房源交付，若该项目其他房源的优惠折扣大于之前购房所享折扣的(限与该商品房属于同一户型、同一楼栋、同一单元、同一物业类型的其他未售商品房)，开发商可以为购房者换房并退还差价。	The picture he sent to the reporter shows that the developer of the project promises that for those who purchase properties between February 1 and February 28, from the date of signing the purchase and sale contract to the delivery of the corresponding property, if the discount of other properties in the project is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous purchase (limited to other unsold commercial properties of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type), the developer can change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.	yes
孙先生表示，置业顾问表示这其实就是一份“保价协议”，目的是让买家放心出手，不用担心开发企业降价促销，“现在就怕买完了它就降价了，去售楼处闹吧没时间，不闹的话也确实窝心”。	Mr. Sun said that the property consultant said that this is actually a "price guarantee agreement", the purpose is to let buyers feel at ease, not to worry about the developer's price reduction promotion, "Now I'm afraid that it will reduce the price after I buy it, I don't have time to make a fuss at the sales office, and it's really upsetting if I don't make a fuss."	yes
还有不少买房人则认为，“保价协议”虽然是在给购房者吃“定心丸”，不过条件却不低。	Many homebuyers believe that although the "price guarantee agreement" is to give homebuyers a "reassurance pill", the conditions are not low.	yes
打算在江北买一套刚需房的郑女士说，保价的房源首先是要同一户型，还得在同一楼栋、同一个单元，买家可以比价的房源寥寥，因此“门槛”还是蛮高的。	Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a just-needed house in Jiangbei, said that the price-guaranteed properties must first be of the same type, and must be in the same building and the same unit. The properties that buyers can compare are few, so the "threshold" is quite high.	yes
也有购房者认为，由于信息不对称，销售时不排除给出额外的让利，买家“维权”的难度不小。	Some homebuyers believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not ruled out that additional concessions will be given during sales, and it is not easy for buyers to "defend their rights".	yes
能否留住买房人有待观察	Whether to retain homebuyers remains to be seen	no

The total number of transactions in the project is only 33, accounting for only 13%.	no
市场人士介绍，“保价协议”在2008年也曾在南京出现过。	Market insiders introduced that the "price guarantee agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.	no
当年8月份，河西黄山路上的楼盘横塘西苑为了吸引买房人眼球，推出了《保价计划》，具体内容为“公司郑重承诺，若一年内项目优惠幅度扩大，由此产生的差额，公司将按差额退还给老业主”。	In August of that year, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate project on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched a "price guarantee plan" to attract homebuyers. The specific content was "The company solemnly promises that if the discount of the project expands within one year, the company will refund the difference to the old owners."	no
此后2011年4月，南京也有9家楼盘拿出部分房源承诺“差价赔付”。	Subsequently, in April 2011, nine real estate projects in Nanjing also promised "price difference compensation" for some properties.	no
“楼市在回暖，此时更需要一针‘强心剂’。	"The real estate market is warming up, and it needs a 'cardiotonic' at this time.	no

他认为如今开发企业比买房人更需要信心，推出“保价协议”其实也是在给其打气。	He believes that developers need more confidence than homebuyers today, and the launch of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually to boost their morale.	no
至于能否留住买房人，他表示这取决于调控政策、贷款门槛等多重因素的影响，就目前来看仍有待观察。	As for whether it can retain homebuyers, he said it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds. It remains to be seen at present.	no

台“中央大学”经济系教授吴大任分析，出口衰退可能造成出口制造业厂商现金流出现问题，债务违约风险上升。	Wu Dare, a professor of economics at Taiwan's "Central University", analyzed that the decline in exports may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies, and the risk of debt default is rising.	no
同时，订单减少导致厂商削减人力成本，影响劳动市场和家庭经济，反过来冲击消费能力。	At the same time, the reduction in orders leads to manufacturers reducing labor costs, affecting the labor market and family economy, and in turn impacting consumption capacity.	no
台湾经济研究院研究员邱达生认为，今年欧美通胀状况未解，需求持续萎缩，预估台湾出口衰退会延续到上半年。	Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that this year's inflation situation in Europe and America has not been resolved, demand continues to shrink, and it is estimated that Taiwan's export decline will continue into the first half of the year.	no

她在现场说：“精心打磨的视频收获了很多网友的关注，好多人对我家的食材感兴趣，想跟着一起做美食，销路就一下子打开了。	She said at the scene: "The carefully polished videos have attracted a lot of attention from netizens. Many people are interested in the ingredients in my shop and want to cook with them, which has opened up the sales channel.	yes
”	"	yes
芳芳靠着煲汤视频让更多人爱上“老广的味道”，一场直播最多卖出30万件滋补食材，挽救了家里濒临倒闭的老店。	Fangfang has made more people fall in love with the "old Cantonese taste" through her soup-making videos. In one live broadcast, she sold up to 300,000 pieces of nourishing food ingredients, saving her family's nearly bankrupt old shop.	no
“无内容，不电商”，随着短视频和直播电商不断发展，人们对电商内容的要求和标准正步入新阶段。	"No content, no e-commerce," as short videos and live-streaming e-commerce continue to develop, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.	no
直播带货发展初期，直播间往往用低价折扣吸引用户，价格优势似乎成了当时的唯一卖点。	In the early stages of live-streaming sales, live-streaming rooms often attracted users with low-price discounts, and price advantages seemed to be the only selling point at the time.	no

北京师范大学传播创新与未来媒体实验平台此前发布了《电商行业内容生态健康指数(ECHI)报告》，从数据维度解析了当前电商行业中“新变量”——优质内容的重要性，运用指数对国内27家主流电商平台内容生态情况进行了评估。	The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Ecology Health Index (ECHI) Report", which analyzed the importance of the "new variable" - high-quality content in the current e-commerce industry from a data dimension, and used the index to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China.	no

报告认为，电商行业内容生态是一个综合性概念，是将电商与内容进行整合，但并非所有内容都可与电商整合，好的PGC(专业生产内容)与UGC(用户原创内容)才是与电商进行整合的优质载体，内容平台价值越高，消费与推广的场景也就越来越丰富，电商植入的可能性也就越高，商业价值也就越强，这种公共领域和私人领域逐步集成分布的电商内容生产和内容消费的比例也就会越高。	The report believes that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept, which integrates e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (Professionally Generated Content) and UGC (User Generated Content) are the high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the scenarios for consumption and promotion, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, the stronger the commercial value, and the higher the proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption in the public and private sectors.	no
现场，北京师范大学新闻传播学院教授、中国传媒经济与管理专业委员会理事长喻国明对《报告》做了分析解读。	At the scene, Yu Guoming, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Beijing Normal University and chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Professional Committee, analyzed and interpreted the report.	no
他表示，就内容价值而言，当前电商行业已经从“消费可及性”过渡到“消费品质化”阶段，优质、专业、差异化的内容是电商行业的“硬通货”。	He stated that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumption accessibility" to the "consumption quality" stage, and high-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.	no
同时，内容成为电商发展新阶段的根本和抓手，知识付费、专业性知识、KOL(关键意见领袖)等PGC内容开始在电商直播中成为标配。	At the same time, content has become the foundation and focus of the new stage of e-commerce development, and paid knowledge, professional knowledge, KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) and other PGC content have become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.	no
展望电商行业的未来发展，喻国明提出两方面的建议。	Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.	no
一个是从内容结构提升的角度看，推动电商内容生态健康程度和质量整体提升，打造正向内容创作和管理标准，实现电商行业内容生态健康系统指数与动态均衡。	One is to promote the overall improvement of the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecology from the perspective of content structure improvement, to create positive content creation and management standards, and to achieve a dynamic balance with the health system index of the e-commerce content ecology.	no
另一个是从外部生态看，要实现内容电商行业的健康发展和外部环境的价值协同与共创。	The other is to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment from the perspective of the external ecology.	no
“未来电商行业还需要更多的数据、人工智能方面的支持，形成对未来发展稳定性的预测；此外，为商家提供更规范、健康的成长空间，实现电商行业中企业、用户、产品与服务的价值协同，共创健康内容生态。	"The future e-commerce industry still needs more support in terms of data and artificial intelligence to form predictions for future development stability; in addition, to provide merchants with a more standardized and healthy growth space, to achieve value synergy and co-creation of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and to create a healthy content ecology.	no

这些迹象让外界怀疑金主爱是否已经被内定为金氏政权的继承人，《华盛顿邮报》分析认为“这是金正恩把中学年纪的女儿推上接班人地位的讯号”，不过也有观点认为，这样的判断仍为时过早，在金正恩膝下有儿子的情况中，仍保有各种可能性。	These signs have led outsiders to suspect whether Kim Ju-ae has been designated as the successor of the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong-un is pushing his middle school-aged daughter to the position of successor", but there are also views that such a judgment is still premature, and in the situation where Kim Jong-un has a son, all possibilities are still preserved.	no
重阳问答︱如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Chongyang Q&A | How to view the US non-farm employment data for January exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website	yes
Q：请问重阳投资，如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势？	Q: May I ask Chongyang Investment, how do you view the US non-farm employment data for January exceeding expectations and future trends?	yes
A：2月3日美国劳工部公布2023年1月非农就业数据，新增非农就业51.7万人，大幅高于市场预期的18.9万人；失业率降至3.4%，为近50年以来的最低位；时薪同比增速4.4%，环比增速0.3%，略有放缓。	A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor announced the non-farm employment data for January 2023, with an increase of 517,000 non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; hourly wages increased by 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, slightly slowing down.	yes
从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	In terms of total volume, there are many one-time and technical factors disturbing this data, such as returning teachers from strikes, corrections to survey statistics, updates to seasonal adjustment factors, and subsequent corrections may be made (refer to the revision of non-farm additions in January 2022 from 504,000 to 364,000), non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data shows.	yes
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	In terms of structure, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still there, but the proportion is low; high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care have seen a significant rebound in new jobs, and the data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.	yes
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Combining the similarly exceeding expectations of the service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor gap data rebounding, and strong consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has undergone rapid repair after extreme weather and holidays.	yes
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	We believe that without a recession, it is difficult to improve the supply and demand tension in the US job market.	yes
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	Currently, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 years old is already close to the pre-pandemic peak.	yes
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	In addition, due to the strong excess savings and consumer credit of US residents, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of tightening policies on the job market.	yes
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	The continued tension in the supply and demand of the US job market will be the underlying tone of the US economy in 2023.	yes
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	Adding to the current near-end of interest rate hikes, inflation expectations are constantly repeating, we are not optimistic about the continuous decline in wage growth.	no
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Before the data was released, the US stock, bond and foreign exchange markets were too optimistic about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike path.	no
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Federal Reserve is shortening the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining the fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market ignores the Federal Reserve's hawkish statements, not only expecting to stop raising interest rates in advance, but also expecting two rate cuts at the end of the year.	no
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	In the case of tight supply and demand in the labor market and unclear impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Federal Reserve's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded trading may cause some damage to the market.	no
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the year-on-year M2 data turning negative and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-item leading indicators, the US CPI data has entered a rapid decline stage since October, and the stubbornness of wage growth will only form a bottom for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of game after the next inflation data is released.	no
杉杉创始人郑永刚因突发心脏疾病过世 曾带领中国服装第一股转型 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan, passed away due to a sudden heart disease. He once led China's first listed clothing company to transform - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website	yes
经济观察网 记者 郑淯心 2月11日，认证主体为杉杉控股有限公司（以下简称“杉杉控股 ” ） 的微信公众号发布讣告，杉杉企业创始人、杉杉控股董事局主席郑永刚因突发心脏疾病救治无效，于2023年2月10日去世，享年65岁。	Economic Observer Network reporter Zheng Yu Xin, February 11, the WeChat public account certified by Shanshan Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") announced that Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprises and the chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died of a sudden heart disease on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65.	yes
上世纪80年代，郑永刚担任国营棉纺厂的厂长，随着调任，1989年郑永刚成为杉杉股份的前身宁波云港服装总厂的厂长。	In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of a state-owned cotton spinning factory. With his transfer, in 1989, Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Shares.	yes
2022年12月，在第二十届中国企业领袖年会暨第二十二届中国企业未来之星年会上，郑永刚在演讲中称，在上世纪90年代的中国西服市场，杉杉品牌的市占率曾高达37 % 。	In December 2022, at the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Future Stars Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the market share of Shanshan brand once reached 37%.	yes
1996年杉杉股份（600884.SH）上市，成为中国服装业第一家上市公司。	In 1996, Shanshan Shares (600884.SH) was listed, becoming the first listed company in China's clothing industry.	yes
就在服装业务如日中天时，杉杉集团却开始转型，因为郑永刚意识到 ， “ 一旦市场放开，中国品牌自然会形成一个梯队式品牌市场，杉杉西服想一直独领风骚，长期成为国人的国服的可能性不大 ” 。	Just when the clothing business was booming, Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and it is not likely that Shanshan suits will always lead the trend and become the national dress of the Chinese people in the long term".	yes
1999年，杉杉开始研究企业转型，郑永刚回忆当年 ， “ 我们来到上海，寻求到底转型做什么，专门找了很多专家学者，连续不断地开一些诸葛亮会、务虚研讨会。	In 1999, Shanshan began to study corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai to find out what to transform, and specifically sought many experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings and theoretical seminars.	yes
最后，我们设定了两个大的战略方向。	In the end, we set two major strategic directions.	yes
第一个方向是新能源新材料，另外一个是大健康有未来 ” 。	The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is that big health has a future".	yes
战略方向确定后，杉杉开始寻找合作，那时候鞍山热能院为鞍钢配套的炭素研究所在做国家863课题，科研经费不够，于是杉杉和鞍山热能院碳素研究所签署合作协议，共同推动国家863课题“中间相炭微球”项目产业化，从事负极材料的研发、生产和销售，在国内实现负极材料的商用推广。	After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, Anshan Thermal Energy Institute, which was supporting Ansteel, was conducting a national 863 project. The research funding was not enough, so Shanshan and Anshan Thermal Energy Institute Carbon Research Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Intermediate Phase Carbon Microsphere", engage in the research, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and promote the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.	yes
2001年，杉杉股份实现中间相炭微球的规模化生产，开始国产化替代，取代日本成为国内中间相炭微球主要供应商。	In 2001, Shanshan Shares realized the mass production of intermediate phase carbon microspheres, began to replace imports, and replaced Japan as the main supplier of intermediate phase carbon microspheres in China.	no
这是中国第一家锂离子电池负极材料生产企业，实现了锂离子电池负极材料国产化。	This is China's first lithium-ion battery negative electrode material production enterprise, realizing the localization of lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials.	no
随着锂电池的应用迅速普及，杉杉股份的锂电池业务开始逐步发展，2007年锂电材料业务被写入了杉杉股份的主营业务，服装业务营收占比逐年减少，直至2013年，杉杉股份的锂电材料业务收入全面超过服装业务。	With the rapid popularization of lithium batteries, Shanshan Shares' lithium battery business began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into the main business of Shanshan Shares. The revenue of the clothing business decreased year by year. Until 2013, the revenue of Shanshan Shares' lithium battery material business completely surpassed the clothing business.	no
2021年2月，杉杉股份成功并购LG化学偏光片业务，进军LCD偏光片市场，并成立偏光片企业杉金光电，该领域技术含量比较高，杉杉的主要的竞争对手都是世界500强，如韩国三星、日本的住友化学、日东电工。	In February 2021, Shanshan Shares successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established a polarizer company, Shangjin Optoelectronics. The technology content in this field is relatively high, and Shanshan's main competitors are all Fortune 500 companies, such as Samsung in South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical in Japan, and Nitto Denko in Japan.	no
郑永刚曾分享过投后管理的心得 ， “ 中国的民营企业收购国际上的一些高科技企业，成功概率比较低，为什么那些收购会失败？	Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management, "The success rate of Chinese private enterprises acquiring some high-tech enterprises internationally is relatively low. Why do those acquisitions fail?	no
因为大家都会去考虑，我花了那么多钱，我得去派人管对吧，这是通常会做的一个行为 ” ， 然而郑永刚则不同，杉杉收购成功的那一天，郑永刚就到杉金光电当众宣布，杉杉作为杉金的大股东，决定实施一企两制，除了郑永刚担任董事长，杉杉企业的人不派到杉金，采取授权经营的方式，原有的分配制度、企业文化、各项管理等模式不变。	Because everyone will consider, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to manage it, right? This is a behavior that is usually done", but Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day Shanshan successfully acquired, Zheng Yonggang publicly announced at Shangjin Optoelectronics that Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shangjin, decided to implement a one-enterprise-two-systems policy. Except for Zheng Yonggang serving as the chairman, Shanshan's people will not be sent to Shangjin. They will adopt an authorized operation method, and the original distribution system, corporate culture, and various management modes will remain unchanged.	no

阿拉斯加上空被击落的 “物体”究竟是什么？	What exactly is the "object" shot down over Alaska?	yes
扑朔迷离，猜测纷纷	It's confusing, with many speculations.	yes
美国军方周五（2月10日）下午再次动用美国最先进的隐身喷气战机F-22击落了一个在美国阿拉斯加上空飞行的尚未确定身份的物体。	On Friday afternoon (February 10), the U.S. military once again used the most advanced stealth jet fighter F-22 to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska.	yes
击落的地点距离阿拉斯加海岸十英里。	The location of the shootdown was ten miles off the coast of Alaska.	yes
这是美军在不到一周的时间里第二次击落空中飞行物体。	This is the second time in less than a week that the U.S. military has shot down an airborne object.	yes
上周六，来自中国的一个间谍气球在美国领空上漂移数日后在美国南卡罗莱纳州沿岸附近上空被击毁。	Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China was destroyed in the air near the coast of South Carolina after drifting over U.S. airspace for several days.	yes
五角大楼说，第二个被击落的物体于周四晚上首次进入美国领空，在阿拉斯加东北部上空移动时被美国军方跟踪，飞行高度为1.2万米（4万英尺），其大小与一辆小型汽车差不多，与先前被击落的那个中国间谍气球相比要小很多。	The Pentagon said that the second object shot down first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military while moving over northeastern Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), its size is about the same as a small car, much smaller than the previous Chinese spy balloon that was shot down.	yes
五角大楼还认为，目前没有迹象显示，这个物体是可操纵的。	The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no evidence to suggest that this object is controllable.	yes
白宫国家安全委员会战略沟通协调员约翰·科比周五表示，虽然这个在高空飞行的物体的具体样子尚不清楚，但它“对民航飞机的安全构成了合理的威胁”。	John Kirby, the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, said on Friday that although the exact appearance of this high-flying object is not clear, it "poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aircraft."	yes

科比说，“我们把它称为一个‘物体’是我们目前能够作出的最好的描述”。	Kirby said, "We call it an 'object' is the best description we can make at the moment."	no

美国官方对这个物体的描述大致可以归纳为：大小相当于一辆小汽车，没有操纵杆，没有悬挂装置，飞行高度为一万米左右。	The U.S. official description of this object can be summarized as: about the size of a small car, no joystick, no hanging device, flying at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.	no
但这些信息还无法回答基本问题，比如这个物体究竟是什么东西，它属于哪个国家，它在执行什么任务。	But this information still can't answer basic questions, such as what exactly is this object, which country does it belong to, and what mission is it carrying out.	no
目前网上许多的分析和猜测认为，这可能又是一只中国气球。	Many online analyses and speculations currently believe that this might be another Chinese balloon.	no
它可能与入侵美国领空的那只间谍气球和在拉美上空飘动的那只中国气球一样都来自中国，它们在不同地点执行某种任务。	It may come from China like the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon floating over Latin America, they are carrying out some kind of mission at different locations.	no
也有人把阿拉斯加的这个“物体”与“不明飞行物”（UFO）联系在一起。	Some people have linked this "object" in Alaska with "Unidentified Flying Objects" (UFOs).	no
美国新闻周刊的报道引用美国前众议员彼得·梅杰（Peter Meijer）周五在推特上发出的推文说，“真希望这个‘不明飞行物’也是一个间谍气球，而不是一个合法的UFO”。	A report in Newsweek quoted a tweet from former U.S. Representative Peter Meijer on Friday saying, "I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO."	no
“将外星飞船与气象气球混为一谈的讽刺意味很令人惊讶，但这不值得引发一场星际冲突，”梅杰说。	"The irony of conflating alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it's not worth triggering an interstellar conflict," Meijer said.	no
梅杰是在科比证实阿拉斯加的这个物体被击落之后不久发出这个推文的。	Meijer tweeted this shortly after Kirby confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.	no
新闻周刊说，怀疑这个物体是UFO的不止是梅杰一人。	Newsweek said that Meijer is not the only one who suspects that this object is a UFO.	no

As a consumer, I demand to get the goods I should get. I didn't make any exaggerated demands, but Amazon changed the name and said there was no stock.	yes
这是我的第一个长评，希望这不是我的最后一个。	This is my first long review, I hope this is not my last one.	yes
让人无法理解的袖子	Incomprehensible sleeves	yes
说是牛皮的，也确实比较硬，但仔细看的话，局部有很多细小的裂痕，搞不清楚是否是真皮的，另外这个衣服的袖子真是让人无法理解，通常夹克的袖子要比衣摆长一些，不过通常也就1-2厘米，这件衣服足足长了5厘米，手臂自然下垂应该在手掌虎口的位置，但这件衣服的袖子都盖过手指了。	They say it's made of cowhide, and it is indeed quite hard, but if you look closely, there are many tiny cracks in certain areas, making it unclear whether it's real leather. Moreover, the sleeves of this garment are truly incomprehensible. Usually, the sleeves of a jacket are longer than the hem, but typically only by 1-2 centimeters. This garment, however, is a full 5 centimeters longer. When the arm naturally hangs down, it should be at the position of the tiger's mouth of the palm, but the sleeves of this garment cover the fingers.	yes
买衣服容易，退货也容易。	Buying clothes is easy, and returning them is also easy.	yes
但是要退还钱真不知何时？	But when will the money be refunded?	yes
衣服做工不错，因为版型偏小，只得退货，但是退了货以后，至今一个多星期过去了，还没有收到退款？	The clothes are well made, but because the size is too small, I had to return them. However, after returning the goods, it has been more than a week and I have not received a refund yet?	yes
而且要购买者自已和那个诚信度不怎么样的全峰快递联系，这是自购亚马逊的物品以来最糟糕的一次购物！	Moreover, the buyer has to contact Quanfeng Express, which is not very trustworthy. This is the worst shopping experience I've had since buying items from Amazon!	yes
但店家还是不错的，积极配合催促快递及时退款，但是这个全峰快递实在的工作是做的相当让人愤怒，拖拉半个月左右才退款，这种合作伙伴是要拖亚马逊的后腿的，工作效率差，没有服务意识！	But the store is still good, actively cooperating to urge the courier to refund in time, but the work of this Quanfeng Express is really infuriating, dragging on for about half a month before refunding. This kind of partner is going to drag Amazon down, with poor work efficiency and no service awareness!	yes

第一次亚马逊用的合作的天天烂快递，第一次送货没在家，后来主动和快递员约了两次送货时间，那个快递员都不送，后来直接给我退货了，这个该死的快递员一点诚信也没有，强烈建议不要再用那个天天烂快递了。	This is the first time Amazon used the cooperative Tiantian rotten express, the first time the delivery was not at home, then I actively made two delivery appointments with the courier, that courier did not deliver, then directly returned the goods to me, this damn courier has no integrity at all, strongly suggest not to use that Tiantian rotten express again.	yes
这一次还有一件体恤衫也给我退货了，再拍也涨价了一百多元。	This time there is also a T-shirt that was returned to me, and the price has gone up by more than a hundred yuan if I take another shot.	yes
亚马逊自营不应该出现这样商品	Amazon's self-operated business should not have such products.	yes
产品特价的时候购买，价格不低，看评论也是很不错的产品。	I bought the product when it was on special offer, the price was not low, and the reviews were also very good.	yes
实际收到产品的时候让我目瞪口呆，商品表面大面积磨损，多处其他地方都有磨损，不是次品就是旧品，稍后上图。	When I actually received the product, I was dumbfounded. The surface of the product was largely worn, and there were wear and tear in many other places. It was either a substandard product or a used one, I will upload pictures later.	yes
我申请退货，厂家的人看到图片后说是运输导致，这不是瞎说吗？	I applied for a return, and the manufacturer's representative said it was caused by transportation after seeing the pictures. Isn't this nonsense?	yes
商品内部怎么可能磨损？	How could the inside of the product be worn?	yes
只有两种可能，要么次品旧品，要么就是我故意损坏商品，然后拿去退货。	There are only two possibilities, either it's a substandard or used product, or I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.	yes
客观来讲，我没有证据证明我没有损坏商品，但是以我在亚马逊购物的信用记录来讲，我认为这样的商品不应该出现在亚马逊自营商品中，客户选择亚马逊自营就是信任，customer win，we win，客户的胜利就是厂商的胜利，希望大家一起努力改进，谢谢。	Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the product, but considering my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I believe such products should not appear in Amazon's self-operated products. Customers choose Amazon's self-operated products because they trust them. Customer win, we win. The customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory. I hope everyone will work together to improve. Thank you.	yes
我使用该产品不到一年，就出现两个E2，我不知道如何处理?	I have been using this product for less than a year, and two E2s have appeared, I don't know how to deal with it?	yes
我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?	I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two groups on the right side of the receiver often showed red E2, which should be a problem with the transmitter module, right? This doesn't quite match what the Amazon website says about the transmitter module being able to work continuously for 7 years, right? I can't find after-sales service on the Amazon website, and now I don't know what to do?	yes
还行吧	It's okay.	yes

换货挺迅速，晚上有点模糊，视角不是很广，但是普通家用够了。	The exchange was quite fast, it's a bit blurry at night, the view angle is not very wide, but it's enough for ordinary home use.	yes
不足就是没有卡，自己买的，还有就是以前在亚马逊买过手机。	The only drawback is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I have bought a mobile phone on Amazon before.	yes
包装上会有贴纸，防止包装被打开，这次没有，买手机时候还有个贴纸一样的章，可以贴在保修卡上，这次没有。	There will be stickers on the packaging to prevent the packaging from being opened, but not this time. When buying a mobile phone, there is a sticker-like stamp that can be stuck on the warranty card, but not this time.	yes
不知道是不是东西便宜了就没有，很困惑。	I don't know if it's because the things are cheaper, there is none, it's very confusing.	yes
等待供货商回复	Waiting for the supplier's response.	yes
包装没有任何标识，直接给供货商致电说，回答没标识是正品，如怀疑可用边角料邮寄到强生公司验货，还留下车牌号以及电话号码，承诺会发短信通知把我的信息输入强生官网保修卡，到现在也没收到短信啊？	The packaging has no markings, I directly called the supplier and they said that the lack of markings indicates it's genuine. If in doubt, you can send scrap materials to Johnson & Johnson for inspection.

日本亚马逊因为客服问题导致买家的利益严重受损（8c的毛毛虫发货为8cm的毛毛虫）（8c=14cm，8cm=2c）	Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service issues (8c caterpillar shipped as 8cm caterpillar) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)	yes
承认错误，但是一直在推诿，始终强调货物为第三方，不能约束第三方。	Admitting the mistake, but always shirking, always emphasizing that the goods are third-party and cannot constrain the third party.	yes
订单编号：503-4265464-1830254。	Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.	yes
我当初购买的页面尺码选项为7c，8，9c，当时觉得这就是个陷阱，打电话给日亚中文客服，明确告知8就是8c，但是等商品回到中国才发现，只有8cm，我觉得这完全是故意设下的陷阱来坑中国人（按照亚马逊的售后），现在查看页面已没有这个选项。	The size options on the page I originally purchased were 7c, 8, 9c. I felt this was a trap at the time. I called the Chinese customer service of Amazon Japan and was clearly told that 8 is 8c. But when the goods returned to China, I found out it was only 8cm. I think this is a trap deliberately set to pit Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales). Now this option is no longer available on the page.	yes
中方客服：很抱歉，给你带来损失了，我们给你两条路走：	Chinese customer service: We are very sorry for your loss. We give you two options:	yes
1，你退货，买家承担所有运费。	1. You return the goods, and the buyer bears all shipping costs.	yes
2，你不退货，我们补偿你1000日元。	2. You don't return the goods, we compensate you 1000 yen.	yes
（我算一下账，鞋子4000多日元，算作200rmb，选择1，我没有鞋子，损失在200元。	(I calculated the account, the shoes are more than 4000 yen, counted as 200rmb, choose 1, I have no shoes, the loss is 200 yuan.	yes
选择2，我有鞋子，最后补偿了我2000日元，最后损失在150rmb 客服：我们已记录下来，我们会认真处理，次日回了封邮件，说我不接受中方客服调解，就这么完了。	Choose 2, I have shoes, and finally compensated me 2000 yen, the final loss is 150rmb) Customer service: We have recorded it, we will deal with it seriously, and sent an email the next day, saying that I do not accept the mediation of Chinese customer service, and that's it.	yes
我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	I proposed: When the purchase page is 7c, 8, 9c such confusing options, the Chinese customer service told me that the commonly used codes in Japan will not carry c like this, similar to 140, but have you guys gone to other caterpillar pages to see?	yes
都有美码，日码混标的情况出现。	There are situations where American codes and Japanese codes are mixed.	no
再说，你8cm为什么放在7c和9c中间，明明最小的尺码，你放那里算什么意思。	Moreover, why do you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, which is clearly the smallest size, what does it mean to put it there.	no
中方客服：我们提供中文服务，但是不知道你要运回国，所以你的运费我们是不予理赔的。	Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know that you want to ship back to the country, so we will not compensate for your shipping costs.	no
这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	I don't understand this logic. I am Japanese. I still need Chinese customer service. Chinese living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service. Tourists to Japan don't have the time to make international long-distance calls. So the question is, who needs to call Amazon overseas purchase Chinese phone, nothing more than people like me who shop in Japan.	no
亚马逊中文客服不就是方便了我们海淘的这些人吗？	Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just to facilitate people like us who shop overseas?	no
这次购买不是很满意	I'm not very satisfied with this purchase.	yes
这是第二次从亚马逊上购买帮宝适尿布，曾经在宝宝2个月的时候买过一箱，选择了欧洲进口纸张的尿布，第一次购买经历还是比较满意的，宝宝整夜就用一张尿布，的确可以满足12个小时不换尿布。	This is the second time I've bought Pampers diapers from Amazon. I once bought a box when the baby was 2 months old, choosing diapers made of imported European paper. The first purchase experience was quite satisfactory. The baby used only one diaper all night, which indeed could last for 12 hours without changing.	yes
但是这次购买L号的尿布，一箱里面有2包分开包装，打开后就觉得纸张比较松，跟进口帮宝适有明显区别，给宝宝用了之后，还算可以，没有漏尿也没有红疹等迹象。	But this time I bought size L diapers, there are 2 packs separately packaged in a box. After opening, I felt that the paper was rather loose, which was significantly different from the imported Pampers. After using it for the baby, it was okay, there was no leakage or signs of rash.	yes
但是到了第二包尿布，开始使用后宝宝的大腿内侧立马就出现了红疹，至今还没有褪去。	But when it came to the second pack of diapers, as soon as I started using them, a rash appeared on the inside of the baby's thighs, which has not faded yet.	yes
怀疑1箱里面的2包，质量还不一样啊。	I suspect that the 2 packs in one box are not even of the same quality.	yes
以后应该不会继续购买了！	I probably won't continue to buy in the future!	yes
希望重视包裹的运输保护	Hope to pay attention to the protection of package transportation.	yes
这是我网购这么久以来，看到最差的一次包装运输，完全没有什么保护措施，缓冲泡沫，包裹缓冲层材料等，什么都没有。	This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen in my online shopping experience, there are no protective measures at all, no buffering foam, no package buffering layer materials, nothing.	yes
就一个压变形的箱子。	Just a deformed box.	yes
而且里面的软胶盒包装的，卡盒都压开了压到变形了。	And the soft plastic box inside, the card box has been crushed and deformed.	yes
希望是正品 质量有保证，以后是不怎么敢亚马孙买东西的了。	I hope it's genuine and quality assured, I'm not so brave to buy things from Amazon in the future.	yes
宁愿国内贵一半，有保障点。	I'd rather pay half more domestically, for more assurance.	yes
而且商品产品包装问题，我看评论2016年就有人评论过，到现在19年，还是老样子。	And the problem with product packaging, I saw comments in 2016, and now it's 2019, it's still the same.	yes
说明亚马逊根本就不重视服务反馈这一块，和国内的京东、天猫等差太远了。	This shows that Amazon doesn't pay attention to service feedback at all, it's far behind domestic Jingdong, Tmall and others.	yes
好看，但有点点小遗憾	Pretty, but a bit of a pity.	yes
整个杯子的颜色是我狠喜欢的，橘红色，虽然我家是男宝，但是还是觉得橘红配黄色很亮眼。	The color of the entire cup is one I really like, orange-red, even though I have a boy at home, I still think orange-red paired with yellow is very eye-catching.	yes
比我想象的小一些，不过本来就是拿来带出门用的，所以还可以接受。	It's a bit smaller than I imagined, but it was originally for taking out, so it's still acceptable.	yes
昨晚拿回家试了一下，瓶盖推开之后，吸管和盖子之间的距离太近了，因为吸管的位置是正向垂直的，所以儿子总是要把盖子上面的凸起含住喝水，觉得这个地方是否可以改进一下。	I tried it at home last night, after opening the bottle cap, the distance between the straw and the cap is too close, because the position of the straw is vertically straight, so my son always has to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water, I wonder if this can be improved.	yes
看来其他牌子的吸管杯把吸管做的倾斜还是有道理的，小孩子的东西，真的就是在乎安全和舒适。	It seems that other brands of straw cups make the straw slanted for a reason, children's things, really care about safety and comfort.	yes
轻便大容量	Lightweight and Large Capacity	yes
喜欢它轻便，开口大，就是两个独立的分隔袋对我来说有点多余，感觉不知道装什么好。	I like its lightness and large opening, but the two separate compartments seem a bit redundant to me, I'm not sure what to put in them.	yes
买完发现海外购美亚上还有一只另一个牌子很类似的，才不到两百块。	After purchasing, I found a similar one from another brand on the overseas purchase section of Amazon, which costs less than two hundred yuan.	yes
假货，假的特别厉害	Fake goods, extremely fake.	yes
亚马逊卖假货，我也是服了。	Amazon sells fake goods, I'm really speechless.	yes
客服说因为用了所以不能退货，我没用怎么知道是假货。	Customer service said that because it's been used, it can't be returned. How would I know it's fake if I didn't use it?	yes
因为信任，所以伤心，毕竟是抹脸的用品，真的去实体店买吧，认可贵一点。	Because of trust, I'm heartbroken. After all, it's a facial product. Just go to a physical store to buy it, even if it's a bit more expensive.	yes
因为是秒杀，所以没有看评论，我已经提交国家工商总局的电商平台了，我们一起维权吧。	Because it was a flash sale, I didn't look at the reviews. I have already reported it to the National Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform. Let's protect our rights together.	yes
坏了？	Broken?	yes
假货？	Fake?	yes
总之悲剧。	It's a tragedy anyway.	yes
用第二片的时候选的毛孔细致的，但是一打开就一股怪味，以为是正常的，因为没用过这款，然后往脸上贴的时候就整个受不了了，非常冲的味道，无法形容，熏到立马咳嗽了出来，眼睛也很痛，流眼泪，马上摘了去洗脸。	When I used the second piece, I chose the one for fine pores, but as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used this brand before. But when I put it on my face, I couldn't stand it at all. The smell was very strong, indescribable, and it made me cough immediately. My eyes were also very painful and teary, so I immediately took it off and washed my face.	yes
不信邪又开了一片同款的，没有那么重的味道了，现在正在敷。	I didn't believe it and opened another one of the same kind, the smell was not so strong this time, and I'm applying it now.	yes
回想起有点像发廊里劣质烫发水的味道。	In retrospect, it smells a bit like the poor quality perm solution in hair salons.	yes
真无法想象，难倒亚马逊自营的护肤品从此也得避而远之了吗？	I really can't imagine, do I have to avoid Amazon's own skincare products from now on?	yes
奸商啊	Unscrupulous merchants indeed.	yes
当时购买的时候，活动页面上是说满99元赠送“三体全集”，收到货没有这个赠品，打客服电话说要给他们看当时活动的截图，问题是谁买东西还把网页截图保存啊，你们自己做过的活动，还需要顾客帮你们提供啊，各位买家下次要留个心眼，保存证据。	When I made the purchase, the promotion on the page stated that a "Three-Body Trilogy" would be given for free with purchases over 99 yuan. However, I did not receive this gift when I received the goods. When I called customer service, they asked me to show them a screenshot of the promotion at that time. The problem is, who saves screenshots of the webpage when they make purchases? You need customers to provide evidence for the promotions you have run? Buyers, be careful next time and keep evidence.	yes
用后感受	Post-use Feelings	yes
第一次在亚马逊买东西，分别感受有几点，先来说下用完商品的感受吧，第一确实是无痛，也没有刺激味道的东西，总体来说很不错的，静等8分钟左右一擦就掉了，只是会有少量的汗毛渣在上面，不细看是看不出来的，所以说总体是不错的，至于之后都就用一次还要继续观察，继续用才会知道。	This is my first time shopping on Amazon, and I have several impressions to share. Let's start with my feelings after using the product. Firstly, it is indeed painless and doesn't have any irritating smell. Overall, it's pretty good. After waiting for about 8 minutes, it can be wiped off easily, leaving only a small amount of hair residue on the surface, which is not noticeable unless you look closely. So overall, it's pretty good. As for the future, I need to continue observing and using it to know more.	yes
反正我觉得这个东西确实不错。	Anyway, I think this product is really good.	yes
第二从27号下单，12号收到货，总共15天也就是半个月，亚马逊的送货员服务态度也很好。	Secondly, I placed the order on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th, a total of 15 days or half a month. The delivery service of Amazon is also very good.	yes
第三，亚马逊的什么黑色星期五就不要相信了，星期五下单，等了2天就便宜了接近12块钱，也就是我买成170多（加上运费什么的），有一种搞活动就提价格的感觉样。	Thirdly, don't believe in Amazon's Black Friday. I placed an order on Friday, and after waiting for 2 days, the price dropped by nearly 12 dollars, which means I bought it for more than 170 (including shipping fees), giving me a feeling that they raise prices during promotions.	yes
客服说什么价格波动，我关注了10多天价格也就是这个样，波动也不大的。	Customer service mentioned price fluctuations, but I've been monitoring for more than 10 days and the price has been pretty stable.	yes
价格实惠，日原产，有中文标签，带颗粒，绝对回购！	Affordable, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, granulated, will definitely repurchase!	yes
膏体里带颗粒的，清爽感恰到好处，用后牙齿爽滑，上比某二手东强太多啦，那里说是进口的东西，可好多东西没有中文标签，不知从哪里批发的。	The paste contains granules, the refreshing feeling is just right, teeth feel smooth after use, much better than a certain second-hand east, they claim to import things, but many things do not have Chinese labels, I don't know where they wholesale from.	yes
以后只要亚马逊有的，绝不再去二手东。	From now on, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to the second-hand east again.	yes
给个建议，亚马逊的app 上晒单怎么有时晒不了，希望能改进一些应用，会做的越来越好的！	Here's a suggestion, sometimes I can't post reviews on Amazon's app, I hope some improvements can be made to the application, it will get better and better!	yes
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	Excellence has been getting worse over the years, there is no service quality to speak of!	yes
垃圾卓越不顾及客户需求 下订单的时候特别配送时间19:00-22:00。	The rubbish Excellence does not consider customer needs when placing orders, especially delivery time from 19:00 to 22:00.	yes
因家里有术后卧床不方便的老人在，所以只有晚上可以方便收件。	Because there is an elderly person at home who is inconvenient to move around after surgery, it is only convenient to receive packages at night.	yes
结果竟然中午12点就直接上门送了，也不事先电话告知。	As a result, they directly delivered at 12 noon without prior notice.	yes
如果配送时间是你们快递员随心所欲的想几点就几点送，何必假惺惺弄个时间让客户选择？	If the delivery time is whenever your courier wants, why bother to set a time for customers to choose?	yes
如果自己的物流没办法保证服务的，那就干脆不要做电商了！	If your own logistics can't guarantee the service, then simply stop doing e-commerce!	yes
让一个身上3处伤口的老人下床开门收快递还要找零钱付费！	Let an old man with three wounds on his body get out of bed to receive the courier and also find change to pay!	yes
明明订单上有联系电话！	There is clearly a contact number on the order!	yes
从头到底也没有人来电话联系一下给个解释！	No one has ever called to give an explanation from beginning to end!	yes
卓越网所谓的投诉客服就是一帮子外地人在那里装样子，敷衍你的投诉然后给你一个所谓的答复。	The so-called customer service for complaints on the Excellence website is just a bunch of outsiders pretending, dealing with your complaints and then giving you a so-called reply.	yes
不会有任何改变或者补偿！	There will be no changes or compensation!	no
之前也是遇到这样子了类似配送时间不对的问题也就忍了，但这次无法忍受，太过分了！	I've encountered similar problems with incorrect delivery times before and tolerated it, but this time it's unbearable, it's too much!	no
新书买的预售到货后竟然封面和封底是反的，这样子明显得质量问题就这样子闭眼把书发给顾客了？	The new book I bought was delivered with the cover and back cover reversed, such a clear quality issue and they just closed their eyes and sent the book to the customer?	no
留言差评也不会有人来联系你。	Leaving a negative review will not get anyone to contact you.	no
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	Excellence has been getting worse over the years, there is no service quality to speak of!	no
不会再在卓越上花一毛钱。	I will not spend a penny on Excellence again.	no
图片质量实在不能接受	The quality of the images is simply unacceptable.	yes
作为“古地图集”这样的标题，本书在图片的选择、排版、印刷上实在令人难以接受，有些图片甚至有马赛克，模糊到无法辨识。	For a book titled "Ancient Map Collection", the choice, layout, and printing of the images are simply unacceptable, with some images even pixelated to the point of being unrecognizable.	yes
即便本书不是专业的地图册，即便是小画幅插图，也应该对得起目录中祖先留下来的洋洋大观的中古文献资料！	Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is small-format illustrations, it should do justice to the grandeur of the medieval documents left by our ancestors in the catalog!	yes
（况且很多图片是可以从相关行业资源中获取清晰的原始文件的），用这样的图片来拼凑图书与不使用图片有何差别？	(And many of the images can be obtained from related industry resources in clear original files), what's the difference between using such images to piece together a book and not using images at all?	yes
！我为这样的治学精神感到遗憾。	! I regret such an academic spirit.	yes
文字方面不予评价，方家各有分辨。	I will not comment on the text, each family has its own discernment.	yes
整体2星。	Overall 2 stars.	yes
高二的时候看的这本书当时只是抱着无聊看看玩的心态，感觉这样的书自己应该不会沉迷吧，毕竟起点的网文以往还是不太吸引我的。	I read this book when I was in my second year of high school, just out of boredom, thinking that I wouldn't get addicted to such a book, after all, web novels from Qidian were not usually my cup of tea.	yes
然后...就掉坑里了。	Then... I fell into the pit.	yes
按着这个剧情来说，整本书都是比较轻松愉快的，前部分叶修还在网游里的时候，即使是公会之间勾心斗角，也因为往往被叶神狗血，搞得一点也不沉重。	Following the plot, the whole book is quite relaxed and enjoyable. In the early part when Ye Xiu was still in the online game, even if there were intrigues between guilds, it was not heavy because it was often made light-hearted by Ye.	yes
至于到了比赛的部分，写出了时代的变迁新旧交替的一点点心酸之感（可能是我多愁善感）。	As for the competition part, it wrote about the slight sadness of the changing times and the alternation of old and new (maybe I'm sentimental).	yes
看整部书花了我高二许多学习时间，可是就是停不下来。	Reading the whole book took up a lot of my study time in my second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.	yes
全职对人物和感情线的描写让人十分惊艳，有的人物只是偶尔带过，也会给人留下很深的影响，像比较重点描写的角色叶修黄少天苏沐橙都有大量的粉丝，而不在写作中心的角色例如江波涛楚云秀等等也十分找人喜欢，在一个电竞的爽文中竟然让人找不到一个让人讨厌至极的人物，这是全职在人物描写上的成功。	The Full-Time series' depiction of characters and emotional lines is very impressive. Some characters are only occasionally mentioned, but they leave a deep impression. Characters like Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mucheng, who are more focused on, have a lot of fans, and characters not at the center of the writing like Jiang Botao and Chu Yunxiu are also very likable. In a refreshing e-sports novel, it's surprising that there isn't a character that is extremely annoying. This is a success of Full-Time in character depiction.	yes
而在感情线上，全职也没有一般网文所令人诟病的后宫佳丽三千万要么美女要么腐的毛病，全文所有人的感情，都有一个共同的地方就是他们喜欢着荣耀这个游戏，并且大都想要堂堂正正的胜利。	In terms of emotional lines, Full-Time doesn't have the common problem in web novels of having a harem of millions of beauties or rotten girls. All the characters' emotions have one thing in common: they all like the game Glory and most of them want to win honorably.	yes
小计量有却没有什么大阴谋，每个人看上去都那么单纯可爱。	There are small plots but no big conspiracies, everyone seems so pure and cute.	yes
这或许也是为什么全职没有什么令人讨厌的角色。	This might also be why there are no annoying characters in Full-Time.	yes
全职的IP很大，也归功于此。	The IP of Full-Time is very big, which is also due to this.	yes
撇开网文这个文化现象不谈，全职不失为一本不错的书。	Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of web novels, Full-Time is a good book.	no
多少他真的会给人提供一些热血，一点点感动。	It really provides some passion and a little bit of touching.	no
今年4月份全职要动漫化。	In April this year, Full-Time is going to be animated.	no
其实想要买齐这套书很久了，碍于永远钱包不够厚都没狠下心下手，然后想要买的时候就发现，tb上简直是假货猖獗，其实全职最近出了另一个版本，封面图吧我自己是蛮喜欢的，但还是打算先买老的版本，所以就在亚马逊上看了看，一次性买下来了一套。	I've actually wanted to buy the whole set for a long time, but due to my always thin wallet, I never had the heart to do it. When I wanted to buy it, I found that there were a lot of fakes on Taobao. Actually, Full-Time recently released another version, I quite like the cover, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I looked on Amazon and bought a set all at once.	no
接下来简单说一下货的情况。	Next, I'll briefly talk about the condition of the books.	no
●第四本的塑封没有，但书是新的。	● The fourth book is not shrink-wrapped, but the book is new.	no
●第十七本塑封是在但是被打开了，书的质感也很奇怪感觉没有其他的硬。	● The seventeenth book is shrink-wrapped but has been opened, and the texture of the book is strange, it doesn't feel as hard as the others.	no
●第23本和第十七本情况一样，但是也比第十七本硬，但十分的旧。	● The 23rd book is the same as the 17th, but it's harder than the 17th, but very old.	no
●个别几本书的出版社不同好像第23和17就是同一个出版社，和其他的不同。	● A few books are from different publishers, like the 23rd and 17th are from the same publisher, which is different from the others.	no
●整体来讲还算满意，24本很大一箱，很满足。	● Overall, I'm quite satisfied, 24 books in a big box, very satisfying.	no
落寞的小狮子	The Lonely Little Lion	yes
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner", but there's actually a lot of text!	yes
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	I read it three times before I finished reading this book to the little ones, a little lion who can shoot, a little lion who loves to eat fruit juice gummies.	yes
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	When I saw the plot of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a bit uncomfortable, modern city people can't quite accept such an arrangement of being eaten by animals.	yes
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	In the end, this little lion who succeeded in human society, lost himself, he is no longer a complete lion, nor a complete human.	yes
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	In the end, only the little lion's back is left, I don't know where he went.	yes
可能多年以后，这个小狮子的形象还留在长大了的小朋友的印象中，在某一天不经意的时候被想起，或许对她会有触动或是启发。	Perhaps many years later, the image of this little lion still remains in the impression of the grown-up children, and is remembered inadvertently one day, perhaps it will touch or inspire her.	yes
性价比很高的作品集	High cost-performance portfolio	yes
1、以前还不知道TASCHEN，最近买了不少他们的书，原因就是太强悍，不论是选题还是制作本身。	1. I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but recently I bought a lot of their books, because they are too powerful, whether it's the choice of topics or the production itself.	yes
本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	This work has been released in 3 versions. The largest version is the same as the complete works of Michelangelo, both are close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the medium version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and it comes with a box set of two books.	yes
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	I personally think it's acceptable. Firstly, the price is cheap, and the 700+ pages are divided into two books, which are also easy to flip through as paperback; secondly, unlike the complete works of Michelangelo, the paintings are the main part, and the black and white manuscripts of Da Vinci make up the majority. For readers with limited budgets and non-art majors, this version has the highest cost-performance ratio for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.	yes
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	2. The commentary on the painting part is great, with composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as The Last Supper), but I don't know if it's a printing or book size issue, some shadow parts are too deep, and the details are not clear, which is a bit regrettable.	yes
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscript content is much richer.	yes
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius, and the latter's wide range of interests and high achievements cannot be described as genius.	yes
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	If you could only experience half of Da Vinci by looking at his paintings before, you would be completely speechless after reading his manuscripts.	yes
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Trash, whoever buys it will regret it!	yes
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	I never give bad reviews, but this is genuinely trash, a waste of money. Give me a reason!	yes
1.走时不准，突然变成1月1号，时间归零了。	1. The time is inaccurate, it suddenly becomes January 1st, the time resets.	yes
2.劣质皮带，都不是硅胶的，带了手腕过敏起泡。	2. Inferior quality strap, it's not even silicone, wearing it causes wrist allergies and blisters.	yes
3.经常连不上手机。	3. Often can't connect to the phone.	yes
4.续航只有五天。	4. The battery life is only five days.	yes
5.睡眠检测不显示，时间是0。	5. Sleep detection does not display, the time is 0.	yes
6.不防水。	6. It's not waterproof.	yes
7.其他。	7. Other.	yes
物流太慢	The logistics are too slow.	yes
显示10月16号到，结果21号才收到，差评！	It showed that it would arrive on October 16th, but I didn't receive it until the 21st, bad review!	yes
快递太差，亚马逊上买东西本来就慢，没想到会这么慢！	The delivery is too poor, buying things on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow!	yes
总体满意	Overall satisfied	yes
之前一开始还担心相机的包装，这次还好，里面有充气包，相机三码一致，也能在官网注册，快门次数0，其余的就只能等时间检验了 。	At first, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was okay, there was an air bag inside, the camera's three codes matched, and it could be registered on the official website, the shutter count was 0, the rest can only be tested over time.	yes
发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	The delivery speed is quite fast, here I want to complain about the courier, he just left the valuable item at the door and left quickly, I had no chance to open the box and check it in front of him, I'm speechless about this.	yes
商家发货前做到了为客户着想:)	The seller has considered the customer before shipping :)	yes
商家比较负责，专门打电话问所用相机的屏幕尺寸，确实替客户着想了。	The seller is quite responsible, specifically calling to ask about the screen size of the camera used, truly considering the customer.	yes
发货速度也快。	The delivery speed is also fast.	yes
金刚膜贴上去也挺合适和管用的。	The screen protector fits well and is useful when applied.	yes
电池充不满	The battery cannot be fully charged.	yes
机器确实不错，想问下怎么第一次充电起就充不满啊，充电指示灯一直红色	The machine is indeed good, I want to ask why it can't be fully charged the first time it is charged, the charging indicator light is always red.	yes
目前找不到亚马逊官方反馈渠道，所以只能在商品评价里反馈	Currently, I can't find an official feedback channel on Amazon, so I can only provide feedback in the product reviews.	yes
1. 在 3 月 29 号，通过预购途径使用 31 元购买了此书，显示 3 月 31 号会推送到设备上，此时亚马逊官网上还无法预览该书（因为还未发布）；	1. On March 29, I pre-ordered this book for 31 yuan, it showed that it would be pushed to the device on March 31, at this time the book could not be previewed on the official Amazon website (because it had not been released yet);	yes
2. 3 月 31 号推送到设备上的书，内容是空白，只有敬请期待，而亚马逊上该书电子版降价到了 18 元；	2. The book pushed to the device on March 31 was blank, only saying "please look forward to it", and the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced to 18 yuan;	yes
3. 这两天反复尝试将设备上的下载的空白的书进行删除，再次同步，都无法获取到包含实际内容的电子版《商业的本质》，但是看到亚马逊官网已经可以预览该书。	3. I have tried repeatedly in the past two days to delete the blank book downloaded on the device and sync again, but I can't get the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" with actual content, but I see that the book can now be previewed on the official Amazon website.	yes
目前我有几点感想	I have a few thoughts at the moment	yes
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	1. The issue of price is not the most important thing, the key is how to replace the blank book on the Kindle with a book with actual content, instead of always downloading "please look forward to it"	yes
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	2. I probably won't buy pre-ordered books in the future, after all, if it's postponed, downloading another book with empty content seems very complicated;	yes
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	3. I hope Amazon can provide a normal channel to feedback such issues, so that there is a place to feedback when there are doubts about the download or use of e-books (work orders, online customer service are all acceptable, you can refer to how the Microsoft official store does it)	yes
不是很推荐阅读	I don't highly recommend reading it.	yes
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	I read it a long time ago, and just happened to see it, so I'll write some impressions from memory.	yes
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	This book is less a collection of short stories than a collection of fragments about love in life.	yes
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The tone of this book is extremely plain, as plain as plain water. The choice of words and sentence construction pursue simplicity to the extreme, and the plot is as quiet and plain as a street on a summer afternoon.	yes
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Each short story is a snapshot of a small period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.	yes
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	Finally collected together, it is titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love".	yes
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I think, this collection of short stories, and its title, is like a kind of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not only the joys and sorrows on the stage, the eternal love in urban legends, nor just the inseparable intimacy between you and me. Love is not only the above but should not be represented by the above. Love is also a plain life like water, a boring day after day, and there is also a sense of helplessness in life, the escape from reality, and the confusion about the future.	yes
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	When you read this book, you may recall the quarreling couple beside you, the tasteless marriage of people you know, and the unsatisfactory feelings.	yes
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	This is exactly why I don't recommend reading it. From an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are tasteless, unless your life is stormy or sweet as if living in a candy castle, otherwise your feeling when reading it is that it's not surprising and boring.	yes
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	And from the depth of thought, the daily plot does not enlighten or expand one's thinking and vision (this is different from Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the short fragments do not discuss any issues, such as what kind of mistakes led to the failure of love?	yes
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?	no
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much difference whether you read it or not.	no
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	The author's ideas are more expressed through techniques and genres rather than story plots, which is also a reason why the reading experience of this book is relatively poor.	no
适合粗读,不能细看。	Suitable for skimming, not for detailed reading.	yes
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	The logic of this book is good, but the content is not rich enough.	yes
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	It explains a lot about what and why of sales theories, but it is weak in how to do it, only pointing out the direction but not giving specific methods.	yes
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	Also, this book feels like it's pieced together.	yes
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	Examples include both domestic and foreign ones; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and unknown people.	yes
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	I don't know if the stories were compiled just for the sake of examples, but it would be more convincing if the author cited cases he personally experienced.	yes
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	The terms for customers keep changing.	yes
标题上还是顾客,正文中就变成客户了。	The title is "customer", but in the text it becomes "client".	yes
电子书中还出现了错别字、标点符号缺失、编号错误的问题。	There are also problems with typos, missing punctuation, and numbering errors in the e-book.	yes
总之,这本书作为理论入门是个不错的选择,但对于已经从事销售工作想要提高销售水平的人就不太适用了。	In conclusion, this book is a good choice for beginners in theory, but not very suitable for those who are already in sales and want to improve their sales level.	yes
快速了解互联网金融的导读书	A Quick Guide to Understanding Internet Finance	yes
这本书很浅，可以说只是一个入门课，可以帮助大家快速了解互联网金融的全貌，但要深入了解，还是要按图索骥，自己去深挖。	This book is quite basic, it can be said to be an introductory course, it can help everyone quickly understand the full picture of Internet finance, but to understand in depth, you still need to follow the clues and dig deeper on your own.	yes
且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	Moreover, the book was written quite early, and it does not mention the content of Alipay and WeChat cultivating user habits through the subsidy war. I'm afraid the share of third-party payments today is not as small as mentioned in the book.	yes
现在好多人外出吃饭都是带个手机就好，商家也因为银行流水太高的原因，弃用银联了。	Nowadays, many people just bring a mobile phone when they go out to eat, and merchants have also abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank turnover.	yes
但还是非常感谢作者写出这本入门书，看得出作者起码有多年的金融观察经验，对国内外的金融发展史都十分熟悉，所以才能写成如此通俗易懂的内容。	But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience, is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.	yes
写高大空很容易，难的是写的通俗易懂。	It's easy to write high and mighty, but it's hard to write in a way that's easy to understand.	yes
欣赏你，更想让你知道！	I admire you, and I want you to know it!	yes
决定一个人工作满意度的第一要素不是薪水高低，而是在工作中是否得到了足够重视和赏识。	The first factor determining a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they receive enough attention and appreciation in their work.	yes
根据马斯洛需求层次理论，在人的基本生存需要得到满足后，最迫切的就是心理需要的满足——希望被理解、被肯定、被赏识。	According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, once a person's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.	yes
确实，对于国人来说，大部分是“爱你在心口难开”，即便是怀有爱、感激与赞赏也是默默放在心里不会说出来。	Indeed, for most people, it's hard to express their feelings verbally, even if they are filled with love, gratitude, and appreciation, they keep it silently in their hearts.	yes
作者在本书中阐述了五种赞赏的语言：肯定的言辞、精心时刻、服务的行为、称心的礼物、身体接触。	The author elaborates on five languages of appreciation in this book: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, tangible gifts, and physical touch.	yes
我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	I think what's important is not knowing what the five languages of appreciation are, but being able to use these five languages from the heart to appreciate and be grateful for the people around you, whether they are family, friends, or colleagues.	yes
其实越是亲密的人越需要赞赏和感恩，这样我们的生活才会变得更加美好。	In fact, the closer the relationship, the more appreciation and gratitude are needed, which will make our lives better.	yes
学会赞赏，企业也能在一定程度上挽留住人才，降低辞职率。	Learning to appreciate can also help companies retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.	yes
感谢译者给我们带来了精彩的国外的思想和世界。	Thanks to the translator for bringing us wonderful thoughts and perspectives from abroad.	yes
由于中西方文化背景等原因，语言之间或多或少会存在差异，如果有机会能看到作者原版相信会收获更多。	Due to differences in cultural backgrounds between the East and the West, there may be more or less differences between languages. If there is a chance to see the original version of the author, I believe there will be more gains.	yes
再次谢谢作者和译者以及编辑们的辛勤劳动！	Thanks again to the author, translator, and editors for their hard work!	no
疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	Suspected to be counterfeit goods, please Amazon strictly review.	yes
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, it's even worse than roadside stall products, there is no gram weight, no barcode, ten bags of packaging are also loose, completely not the characteristics of qualified products; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, I have already applied for a return; it is entirely a quality issue; it is suggested that the seller should keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods; supplement: I bought Heart to Heart again, supermarket 23 yuan/10 rolls, added a few comparison photos, further verified the counterfeit of this product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic loss and further unhappiness!	yes
再度期望亚马逊能够一丝不苟，严把商品源头。	Once again, I hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strictly control the source of goods.	yes
马马虎虎的产品，和期望有差距	A mediocre product, not up to expectations.	yes
优点：	Pros:	yes
1. 大品牌，价格便宜。	1. Big brand, cheap price.	yes
优点2：电机和刀片都是PANASONIC保证的，使用起来也还OK，但是和我期望有差距。	Pros 2: The motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are okay to use, but they do not meet my expectations.	yes
缺点：	Cons:	yes
1. 充电没有指示灯，这个最基本你的电源指示都省下了，估计购买300元产品的客户，在松下PANASONIC的眼里，也是施舍，毫无尊重。	1. There is no charging indicator light, even the most basic power indicator is omitted. I guess for customers who buy a 300 yuan product, in the eyes of PANASONIC, it's a handout, with no respect.	yes
2. 有强烈的异味 充电时候，哪怕仅仅充电10分钟，就可以闻到强烈的塑胶燃烧的那种味道。	2. There is a strong strange smell when charging, even if it's only charging for 10 minutes, you can smell a strong burning plastic smell.	yes
办公室试用了1天，搞的全屋子都是这种塑胶味道。	After testing it in the office for 1 day, the whole room was filled with this plastic smell.	yes
和我之前用过的同价位的飞利浦PHILIPS相比，虽然多了个刀头，但是松下这款产品，质量真是对不起消费者了。	Compared to the PHILIPS product of the same price range that I used before, although it has an extra blade, the quality of this PANASONIC product really lets consumers down.	yes
小包装	Small Package	yes
收到快递一看上面写着电商版就知道又掉坑里了，比超市买的小了好些，应该是M，跟商品介绍上面的图片包装不一样，所谓新版吧。	Upon receiving the express delivery and seeing the words "E-commerce version" written on it, I knew I had fallen into a trap again. It's much smaller than what I bought from the supermarket, it should be size M. The packaging is not the same as the picture on the product description, probably the so-called new version.	yes
三颗星是怪自己马虎没看清楚商品规格，你卖M码电商版我没意见，你货不对版是几个意思？	Three stars because I blame myself for not paying attention to the product specifications. I have no objections if you sell the M size e-commerce version, but what do you mean by delivering the wrong version?	yes
电商套路深，有时间还是去超市买了。	E-commerce is full of tricks, it's better to go to the supermarket when you have time.	yes
就酱紫。	That's it.	yes
味道不喜欢	Don't like the taste	yes
小孩很不喜欢牙膏的味道，每次都说辣，也许用别的词形容才更贴切，小孩的词库里暂时只有这个词。	The child really doesn't like the taste of the toothpaste, always saying it's spicy. Perhaps a different word would be more appropriate, but for now, this is the only word in the child's vocabulary.	yes
搞活动时候买的，很便宜，所以也不好意思给差评了，四星吧，不过不会再买了。	Bought it during a promotion, it was very cheap, so I feel bad giving a bad review. Four stars then, but I won't buy it again.	yes
正品哟 包装好	Genuine product, well packaged.	yes
包装很完整，里面加了充气袋，没有网上评论的只有光秃秃一个产品的样子。	The packaging is very complete, with an air bag added inside, not just a bare product as some online reviews mentioned.	yes
瓶子外包装上还有一层塑料膜像图片上描述的一样，快递也很快，拍下第二天就来了。	The bottle's outer packaging also has a layer of plastic film as described in the picture, and the delivery was very fast, arriving the day after the order was placed.	yes
是正品，只是没货了，不知道什么时候再上架。	It's a genuine product, just out of stock, not sure when it will be restocked.	yes
糟心的一次购物体验	A frustrating shopping experience	yes
黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	I placed an order during Black Friday, but after waiting for a long time, I still didn't receive it. Upon inquiry, I found out that the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues around me and they all said they didn't sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said only the sender could initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. Finally, I found out that the package was mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of transfers, I finally retrieved the package. The outer packaging had been opened, but the product was still intact. I don't know if it has been used or not. Anyway, it was quite frustrating.	yes
错误的配图	Incorrect Illustration	yes
我以为自己能够收到图1这样的耳机，没想到却收到了图2这样的耳机，图物不一致也就算了，耳机左右声音大小不一又是什么意思？	I thought I would receive headphones like those in Figure 1, but instead I received headphones like those in Figure 2. It's one thing for the item to not match the picture, but what does it mean when the sound in the left and right earpieces is not the same?	yes
虽然名称都是一样的，但还是希望大家能够小心注意，另外还请亚马逊负责人及时更换正确的配图，万分感谢。	Although the names are the same, I still hope everyone can be careful. In addition, I would like to ask the person in charge at Amazon to replace the correct illustration as soon as possible. Thank you very much.	yes
操作系统一般般	The operating system is mediocre.	yes
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	After using it for a while, overall the display is okay, I don't feel much difference, it's just that this system is frustrating to look at. The boot time is noticeably slow, and it's impossible to set it up well. The included software doesn't even need to be mentioned, and the response speed is even more average. Compared to my colleague's, it's not on the same level.	yes
看评论说很人性化的设计，我没有找到哪里人性化，遥控器这个常用的上下左右，返回键设计的位置实在是不敢恭维。	The reviews say it has a very user-friendly design, but I can't find where it's user-friendly. The design of the commonly used up, down, left, right, and back buttons on the remote control is really not commendable.	yes
所以呢，就当个电视吧，再外加电视盒之类的用吧。	So, just treat it as a TV, and use it with additional things like a TV box.	yes
降价太厉害了	The price drop is too drastic.	yes
降价太厉害了，一百多入现在99！	The price drop is so drastic, from over a hundred to now 99!	yes
在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	I have accumulated many unrated orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the review content.	yes
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I use this paragraph to review, it means that this product scores at least 85 points or above.	yes
而比较差的产品，我绝对不会偷懒到复制粘贴评价，这样其他消费者在购买的时候会作为参考，而商家也会因此改进商品质量。	For inferior products, I would never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers can refer to it when purchasing, and the merchant will also improve the product quality accordingly.	yes
低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	Good quality at a low price, this is enough if you're not a fanatic!	yes
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	Such an affordable cable, but it should meet the HDMI certification standards. After personal comparison, it easily outperforms domestic Akihabara stuff (which is twice as expensive). The cable is thick and relatively soft, no noise in 7-meter transmission. From now on, I'll stick with Baseus for affordable cables!	yes
东西还可以，但是亚马逊的售后服务真的比其他网站差太多了	The product is okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.	yes
下单后发现下错了，但是取消订单已经取消不了，网页联系在线客服一直显示错误链接，联系不上。	After placing the order, I found that I made a mistake, but I couldn't cancel the order. The webpage always showed an error link when contacting the online customer service, so I couldn't get in touch.	yes
到货后送货员给我打电话，我说我不要了，想取消订单的没取消成功，派送员就拿回去了，说先给我签收上，让我申请退货。	When the goods arrived, the delivery person called me. I said I didn't want it and wanted to cancel the order but couldn't. The delivery person took it back and said he would sign for me first and let me apply for a return.	yes
申请退货时才告知食品类一旦签收不能退货，没办法打电话给亚马逊客服，也是一样说法，签收不能退货。	When applying for a return, I was informed that food items cannot be returned once signed for. I had no choice but to call Amazon's customer service, and they said the same thing, that signed items cannot be returned.	yes
我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I have bought items that cannot be returned according to policy from JD.com and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc., and the customer service always allowed me to return them. Even when the diapers from JD.com had a strong smell after opening, the customer service still allowed me to return them. But with Amazon, it's not possible.	yes
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	Rules are dead, people are alive, how do your customer service handle this?	yes
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	They told me either I accept it myself, or let the delivery person buy it. The delivery person already has a hard job, why should I make him pay for something he didn't buy?	yes
行，我也不退了，我自己收下了，但是必须给你们的服务打1分	Fine, I won't return it, I'll accept it myself, but I must give your service a score of 1.	yes
劝大家不要白花钱	I advise everyone not to waste money.	yes
首先满怀期待购买，觉得都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧，收到了以后看包装觉得还可以，个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感，吃到嘴里完全没有味道，寡淡无味，咬开来果肉一圈是暗黄色就是坏了那种，好坏参着卖的，能吃的也就不到三分之一，劝大家不要买，也不便宜，质量太差了！	Firstly, I bought it with great expectations, thinking that the Le brand wouldn't be too bad. After receiving it, I thought the packaging was okay, and the size was decent. However, one box was mostly soft, which you can't tell from the outside, you have to feel it. When eaten, it had no taste at all, bland and flavorless. When bitten into, the fruit flesh was a dark yellow, indicating it was bad. They mixed good and bad ones for sale, and less than a third were edible. I advise everyone not to buy it. It's not cheap, and the quality is too poor!	yes
吃一堑长一智，以后再也不在电商买水果了！	Once bitten, twice shy, I will never buy fruit from e-commerce again!	yes
产品防伪标识在哪里	Where is the product's anti-counterfeit label?	yes
瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的，从外包装袋看，感觉蹂躏的程度让人揪心，毕竟是食物类的包装太简单了，而且还是属于国际购的，还有没看到什么明显的防伪标识标志，开瓶非常轻松，关键是盖内的一层蜂蜜直接从里面冒出来了，有开口几乎是没有什么粘连性，外国产品都是这样的吗？	The bottom corner of the bottle is severely dented, which should have been caused by a strong impact. Looking at the outer packaging bag, the degree of damage is distressing, especially since it's food packaging and it's too simple. Moreover, it's an international purchase, and I didn't see any obvious anti-counterfeit labels. Opening the bottle was very easy, and the key point is that a layer of honey directly came out from inside the cap. There was almost no stickiness when opened, is this how all foreign products are?	yes
生在中国的我有点不理解了。	As a person born in China, I'm a bit confused.	yes
应该是正品吧？	It should be genuine, right?	yes
还有拍下时提示二十几号到，这个是14号收到的，我第一次在这里海外购，只是把自己的疑惑写下来，或许这都是正常的？	Also, when I placed the order, it indicated that it would arrive around the 20th, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time shopping overseas here, I'm just writing down my doubts, maybe all of this is normal?	yes
提货服务有待改进	The pick-up service needs improvement.	yes
我一共买了5份提货券，在提取时，第一次预约提取3份，结果只寄过来2份，经过多方沟通才确认是漏发、答应后需补发；第二次预约，刚好赶上休息日，网站和微信均无提示需要在工作日预约，造成了不必要的恐慌，建议以后改善。	I bought a total of 5 pick-up vouchers. When I went to pick them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 for the first time, but only 2 were sent. After multiple communications, it was confirmed that one was missed and promised to be sent later. The second appointment happened to be on a rest day. Both the website and WeChat did not indicate that appointments need to be made on working days, causing unnecessary panic. I suggest improvements for the future.	yes
不错的购物	Good Shopping	yes
东西好评！	Positive reviews for the products!	yes
还是比较相信亚马逊自营的东西，现在海外购以后很方便，从国外买回来物流时间比国内也就多几天，不得不说亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的，比走转运要快很多，所以现在很多东西都在海外购上买。	I still trust the products from Amazon's own operations. Now it's very convenient to shop overseas. The logistics time from buying abroad is only a few days longer than domestic. I have to say that Amazon's ability to clear customs from overseas to domestic is very strong, much faster than transshipment, so now many things are bought on overseas shopping.	yes
希望国内商品的质量和价格能够更好一些，很多东西都是国内产的，但是出去转一圈买回来比在国内还便宜，希望改进。	I hope the quality and price of domestic products can be better. Many things are produced domestically, but it's cheaper to buy them after going abroad and coming back. I hope for improvements.	yes
垃圾	Trash	yes
看到这样的包裹，试问大家:觉不觉得是路边的垃圾?	Seeing such a package, I ask everyone: Don't you think it's garbage on the side of the road?	yes
一个塑料易碎的包装，就用一个塑料袋从所谓的德国发过来，这样的包装是负责的吗?	A fragile plastic package, sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag, is this responsible packaging?	yes
我看这样的包装是装垃圾一样的，购买这个产品，包装及其简陋，没有任何防止破损的措施，就一个简单的塑料袋包装，到手后，包裹完全变形了，里面的物品也有破损。	I think such packaging is like trash, buying this product, the packaging is extremely simple, there are no measures to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, after receiving it, the package is completely deformed, and the items inside are also damaged.	yes
如果我只是碰到一个这样的，我认了，买了几个都是这样子，找亚马逊客服，客服就说可以退，但运费垫付，然后运费以礼品卡的形式返回给我。	If I just encountered one like this, I would accept it, but I bought several like this, contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I could return it, but I had to pay for the shipping, and then the shipping cost would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.	yes
我试问一下，我用现金支付运费，你们给我返礼品卡，这是要我自己买你们礼品卡就直说啊，还要自己把产品邮寄到德国仓库，这不是买个产品受罪啊!	I would like to ask, I pay for the shipping with cash, and you give me a gift card in return, are you asking me to buy your gift cards directly? And I have to mail the product to the warehouse in Germany myself, isn't this a hardship for buying a product!	yes
而我一直跟客服说，出现这样的问题是谁的责任，客服却半句不说是他们的责任，连半句责任都不敢担当，这样的售后服务还有什么保障呢? 一句话:认栽!但我估计我这个评价，亚马逊都不会给公布的机会，直接回删除!	And I keep telling customer service, whose responsibility is it for such a problem to occur, but the customer service doesn't say a word about their responsibility, they don't even dare to take half of the responsibility, what kind of guarantee does such after-sales service have? In one word: Accept defeat! But I guess my review won't be given a chance to be published by Amazon, it will be deleted directly!	yes
质量很好5星，物流很差	Quality is very good, 5 stars, but the logistics are very poor.	yes
1，质量很好，秒杀的，价格适中，物超所值。	1, The quality is very good, it's a steal, the price is moderate, and it's worth more than it costs.	yes
2，结实、用料足、焊点牢固、表面处理得当、颜色很好。	2, It's sturdy, made with ample materials, the welding points are solid, the surface treatment is appropriate, and the color is very good.	yes
3，物流是硬伤，3号下的单，11号到的。	3, The logistics are a major flaw, I placed the order on the 3rd, and it arrived on the 11th.	yes
4，如果亚马逊没有标注预计到货时间是2月7号，我或许会很满意。	4, If Amazon hadn't marked the estimated arrival time as February 7th, I might have been very satisfied.	yes
5，但标注了预期到货时间，就相当于给用户一个承诺，当承诺无法兑现的时候，用户很难受。	5, But marking an expected arrival time is like making a promise to the user, and when that promise can't be fulfilled, it's hard for the user to take.	yes
6，如果你没有给予承诺的把握，请不要做出承诺。	6, If you're not sure you can keep a promise, please don't make one.	yes
7，实际上，我非常在意商家做出的承诺。	7, In fact, I care a lot about the promises made by the seller.	yes

金线会掉色	The gold thread will fade in color.	yes
效果还是有的，但感觉是否明显，就看个人咯，或是心理作用。	The effect is there, but whether it's noticeable depends on the individual, or it could be a psychological effect.	yes
有一点不太好的，就是金色的线，本来设计出来是觉得好看，但实际上，这个金线会掉色，往车上一放，如果拿动几次，手上，和车上，会有一些金粉。	One not so good point is the gold thread, which was originally designed to look good, but in reality, this gold thread will fade in color. If you move it a few times in the car, there will be some gold dust on your hands and in the car.	yes
希望产品可以改进。	I hope the product can be improved.	yes
这种方形的，也没啥装饰效果，就不要搞金线上去，掉下来在车上弄脏车还麻烦。	This kind of square one, doesn't have much decorative effect, so don't put gold thread on it. It's troublesome when it falls off and dirties the car.	yes
东西完好，速度可以，分2个包裹还不同包装	The items are intact, the speed is acceptable, divided into 2 packages with different packaging.	yes
8天的速度蛮快的，但就是2件分了2个包裹，包装还不一样，明显一个防震太多了，厚纸板贴着，封了层塑料，外包装也方便拆，一个就国内的快递盒似的，放了几个缓冲气囊就算事了，感觉有点敷衍。	The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it's just that the 2 items were divided into 2 packages, and the packaging is not the same. One is obviously over-protected, with thick cardboard attached, sealed with a layer of plastic, and the outer packaging is also easy to unpack. The other one is like a domestic express box, with a few air cushions put in, which feels a bit perfunctory.	yes
雅兰床垫真心不错	The Eran mattress is genuinely good.	yes

并不是自营商品，亚马逊无耻了	It's not a self-operated product, Amazon is shameless.	yes
页面明确标注自营，实际上由供应商配送，售后由供应商负责，出问题自行联系供货商。	The page clearly marks it as self-operated, but it is actually delivered by the supplier, after-sales service is provided by the supplier, and if there are any problems, you have to contact the supplier yourself.	yes
想取消订单，对不起，订单信息已传递给供应商，不能取消；想退换货，在亚马逊成功申请了退换货，对不起，没有人理你，需要自行联系供货商退货。	Want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, cannot be cancelled; want to return or exchange, applied successfully on Amazon, sorry, no one cares about you, you need to contact the supplier for returns.	yes
这尼玛哪门子自营商品。	What the hell is this self-operated product?	yes
商品不是亚马逊配送，售后亚马逊不承担，客服竟然说“我帮你联系供应商”，还声称就是自营，太无耻了，赤裸裸的不要脸，赤裸裸的对消费者进行欺诈！	The product is not delivered by Amazon, Amazon does not take responsibility for after-sales, the customer service even said "I will help you contact the supplier", and still claims it is self-operated, too shameless, blatantly shameless, blatantly defrauding consumers!	yes
郁闷的体验	Frustrating Experience	yes
之前在别家网购的滤芯，过滤效果不错，28天结束之后再用多一两天也一样没有水垢。	Previously, I bought a filter cartridge from another online store, and the filtration effect was good. Even if I used it for a day or two after the 28-day period, there was no scale.	yes
由于一直以来在亚马逊购置的东西品质都可以，这次就想着在这边买，第一次在亚马逊买滤芯，感觉不太好，不但早早就开始有水垢，而且滤芯一直用到第28天，都会有悬浮的小黑碳粉，真不知道是继续用下去，还是直接扔了好，非常郁闷~	Since the quality of the items I've always bought from Amazon has been good, I thought I'd buy from here this time. This is my first time buying a filter cartridge on Amazon, and the experience is not very good. Not only did scale start to appear early, but there was also floating small black carbon powder in the filter cartridge all the way to the 28th day. I really don't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. Very frustrating~	yes
没有想象的那么好	It's not as good as I imagined.	yes
和我以往用过的插线板比较，外部做工一般，内部如何未拆开看，但愿如店家所描述，从使用方便性上看，每一独立单位是否通电缺少显示	Compared with the power strips I've used before, the external workmanship is average, I haven't opened it to see the inside, but I hope it's as the shopkeeper described. From the perspective of ease of use, whether each independent unit is powered lacks display.	yes
包装破损了，等时间来检验产品的质量。	The packaging is damaged, waiting for time to test the quality of the product.	yes
外包装破损较严重，里面的包装盒似乎是新的，但是说明书好像不是新的，九月才装修，囤货中，希望到时候不会是坏的，请亚马逊解释一下为什么好几个顾客提到包装破损，你们却能安然处之，谢谢！	The outer packaging is severely damaged, the inner packaging box seems to be new, but the instruction manual does not seem to be new. I will be renovating in September, stockpiling goods, I hope it won't be bad by then. Please Amazon explain why several customers mentioned the damaged packaging, yet you can handle it calmly, thank you!	yes
总体不错，有点小问题	Overall not bad, there are some minor issues.	yes
第一次购买滤水壶，看了几篇评价文章，感觉LAICA的性价比高些就选择了这个，收到货按说明书装好了滤芯，试用了一下，感觉总体不错，但是在倒水的时候好像原水会从壶嘴的地方与处理后的水混合（原水仓密封不太严）。	This is my first time buying a water filter jug. After reading several review articles, I felt that LAICA's cost performance was higher so I chose this one. After receiving the goods, I installed the filter according to the instructions and tried it out. Overall, it's not bad, but it seems that when pouring water, the raw water will mix with the treated water from the spout of the jug (the raw water compartment is not very tightly sealed).	yes
用的时候一定要等所有水过滤完再倒出！	When using it, you must wait for all the water to be filtered before pouring it out!	yes
图片不完整	The picture is incomplete.	yes
图片没有拍出侧面的细节，侧面的细节跟主体的风格并不一致，有很大差别，这是其一；这个珠子是泰国产的，没有标明产地，这是其二；没有标明质地，这是其三；我在英国买的时候，分明每项各有盒子，这里只有一个简简单单的塑料袋，而且珠子上面没有任何的产品标志，我哪里判断得出是真是假。	The picture does not capture the details of the side, the details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body, there is a big difference, this is the first point; this bead is produced in Thailand, the place of origin is not marked, this is the second point; the texture is not marked, this is the third point; when I bought it in the UK, each item clearly had its own box, here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there are no product marks on the bead, how can I judge whether it is real or fake.	yes
购买要慎重哦，尤其是买香港出来的东西。	Be careful when buying, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.	yes

这种客户体验和服务比某宝某东真是差一万倍。	This kind of customer experience and service is a million times worse than certain treasure and certain east.	yes
还行，作为新手来说，值得入手	It's okay, for a beginner, it's worth getting.	yes
品相过得去，和极品金刚没得比，之前看过商场那个价格，少说都好几百，我是第一次玩金刚，还行。	The quality is passable, it can't compare with the top-notch Transformers, I've seen the price in the mall before, at least several hundred less to say, this is my first time playing with Transformers, it's okay.	yes
东西不错	The stuff is good.	yes
东西着实不错，送女友的，只是中午我不在加拿快递的时候有些不愉快，物流公司直接放邮件寄存宝里并且没发取件的验证短信给我，害我跑了两趟。	The stuff is really good, it's a gift for my girlfriend. Just that I had some unpleasant experience when the courier arrived at noon when I was not in Canada.

6对我来说我只能继续等待...	6 For me, all I can do is continue to wait...	yes
底不平	Uneven Bottom	yes
因为看点评里说的都很好，所有对这款锅很有期待，拿到手的时候也很喜欢，很轻巧，但开锅的时候就发现问题了，锅底不是平的，中间突起来，周边凹下去，油都跑到周边了，特意买来的开锅大肥肉炸出好多油都没法覆盖中央区域，糊了，开锅都开不了，这样的构造估计没法正常煮菜。	Because the reviews said it was very good, I had high expectations for this pot. When I received it, I really liked it because it was lightweight. However, I found a problem when I started to use it. The bottom of the pot is not flat, it bulges in the middle and sinks around the edges, causing the oil to run to the sides. The large fatty meat I specifically bought to season the pot produced a lot of oil, but it couldn't cover the central area and got burnt. I couldn't even season the pot properly, let alone cook normally with this design.	yes
不知道是否我运气不好，刚好拿到个底子不平的锅，幸亏亚马逊提供一个月的退货服务，果断退了。	I don't know if I was just unlucky to get a pot with an uneven bottom. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I decisively returned it.	yes

虽然看起来是一个很小的缝隙。	Although it looks like a very small gap.	yes

有点心疼那个产品设计师。	I feel a bit sorry for the product designer.	yes
看来美的的产品经理还没有能力去打造这样的水准的产品。	It seems that Midea's product manager does not yet have the ability to create such a standard product.	no
（对于售后小姐的回馈当然不能要求太高，但当我听到售后说道这款产品所有的个体都是这样的，不是只有我买的这件有问题时，她的不以为然和如实重负的情绪让我明白对美的也不能要求太高） 2019-7-7水泵故障出水量少，已经第二次维修，第一次维修后两周又坏了。	(As for the feedback from the after-sales lady, of course, I can't ask too much, but when I heard the after-sales say that all individuals of this product are like this, not only the one I bought has a problem, her indifference and heavy burden of truth made me understand that I can't ask too much from Midea) On July 7, 2019, the water pump failed and the water output was small.

亚马逊说周年活动320大优惠，后来发现大家249,289,299都有，瞬间有种被欺骗感，但是去超市对比了一下依然比同价位各种杂牌划算多了，今后外出可随车携带。	Amazon said there was a big discount of 320 for the anniversary event, but later found out that everyone had 249, 289, 299, and instantly felt deceived. However, after comparing with the supermarket, it's still much more cost-effective than various off-brands at the same price, and it can be carried with the car when going out in the future.	yes

问了一个有5200的朋友，听他描述好像没有我的这个这么松。	I asked a friend who has a 5200, from his description it seems like his doesn't shake as much as mine.	yes

根本不是大号！	It's not large at all!	yes
第二把Totes，1.这把没有伞套 2.伞柄材质一般 3.明明写Large,实际上就是一人用的便捷雨伞,两个人用估计够呛。	The second Totes, 1. This one doesn't have an umbrella cover 2. The handle material is average 3. It clearly says Large, but it's actually a convenient umbrella for one person, it would be a squeeze for two people.	yes
反而之前在美亚买的那把能三个人用无压力。	On the contrary, the one I bought from Amazon US before can be used by three people without any pressure.	yes
感觉不太好	I'm not feeling too good about this.	yes
首先是箱子并不怎么结实，用加按一下就变形了，其次是背面设计的平放时防止箱面的ABS刮花并起不了作用，再次是箱子里面就是一块布包着、拉杆的地方凸显出来..等等，各种不满意，最后拉链有点不顺畅。	Firstly, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms with a little pressure, secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS surface of the box from getting scratched when laid flat, thirdly, inside the box is just a piece of cloth with the handle area protruding.. and so on, various dissatisfactions.

PS：轮子感觉确实挺好的	PS: The wheels do feel quite good.	yes
还可以	It's okay.	yes
优点：这款双肩包比较精致，看起来耐用。	Pros: This backpack is quite delicate and looks durable.	yes
缺点：卡片上的二维码扫不到（搞什么鬼），15.6寸的笔记本放不下（再长一点点行不行），这款双肩包拉链可以锁起来，却不为买家准备一把锁，不可谓服务至上。	Cons: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what's going on), a 15.6-inch laptop can't fit in (can it be a bit longer), this backpack's zipper can be locked, but they don't provide a lock for the buyer, it can't be said to be customer-first service.	yes

一直在用925-25,非常棒，刚收到925-85，笔的质量没的说，样式也非常漂亮，之所以给四星是因为笔有点重，不适合快速写字，笔帽调节铅芯长度处有点晃动，个人意见：925-25要比85更顺手。	I have been using 925-25, it's very good, just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is unquestionable, the style is also very beautiful, the reason for giving four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the pen cap adjustment lead length is a bit shaky, personal opinion: 925-25 is more handy than 85.	yes

开始我以为是那首歌音效的缘故没有多想，可后来听了半天我才发现这个问题很严重，不光偏音，低音效果也没我之前那个听起来好了，还有些许杂音，是只有我买的这个紫色的有这个现象吗？还是现在耳机制造工艺确实不行了呢?	At first, I thought it was because of the sound effects of that song and didn't think much about it, but after listening for a long time, I realized that this problem is very serious, not only is the sound biased, the bass effect is not as good as my previous one, and there is some noise, is it only the purple one I bought that has this phenomenon?

首先说一句刚买了几天就发现降价了，差评，本还算不错，性价比高，cpu和显卡足够应付主流网游和相当一部分大型单机了，散热非常好，但屏幕有点漏光(ips屏的通病)，音响质量不太好，硬盘不好(建议自己花点钱加个固态)，昨天拿去售后检测了一下硬件，没有任何问题，自带的win8.1不太好用，建议升级成10，卖家发货很快，各项询问回答的也很快，收到电脑第二天发票就到了，不错，可惜什么赠品都没有。	First of all, I found out that the price dropped just a few days after I bought it, which is disappointing. The product itself is quite good, with high cost performance. The CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable part of large single-player games. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen has a bit of light leakage (a common problem with IPS screens). The sound quality is not very good, and the hard drive is not good (I suggest you spend some money to add a solid state drive). Yesterday I took it to the after-sales service for a hardware check, and there were no problems. The pre-installed Win8.1 is not very user-friendly, I suggest upgrading to 10. The seller shipped quickly and answered all inquiries quickly. The invoice arrived the day after I received the computer, which is good, but it's a pity that there were no gifts.	yes
(顺便提一句买键盘贴膜一定不要去某宝一家叫E酷数码中心的店买，发货慢质量差，产品有问题不退不换，老板还满嘴脏话，特别曝光一下)	(By the way, if you want to buy a keyboard film, don't go to a shop called E Cool Digital Center on a certain treasure. The delivery is slow, the quality is poor, and they don't return or exchange defective products. The boss also swears a lot, I want to expose this specifically.)	yes
东西很好，平台官僚依旧	The product is very good, but the platform bureaucracy remains.	yes
硬盘质量非常好，性价比绝对高，比香港买还便宜，不急着用和可以忍受物流的话绝对推荐购买。	The quality of the hard drive is excellent, and the cost performance is absolutely high. It's cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you're not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the logistics, I definitely recommend purchasing it.	yes
但不得不说的是亚马逊平台之官僚依旧，与几年前我发誓绝对不用的时候没有改进，你永远查不到实际物流状况，信息永远是几个星期以后送到，永远不能投诉，就是这么官僚！	However, I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform remains the same as when I swore never to use it a few years ago. You can never check the actual logistics status, the information is always that it will be delivered a few weeks later, you can never complain, it's just so bureaucratic!	yes
货收到几天了，物流信息还是10几天后你将会收到货！	I received the goods a few days ago, but the logistics information still says you will receive the goods in about 10 days!	yes
物流不省心	Logistics is not worry-free.	yes
送来成这个样子，不仅包装压扁，电器包装也是开的，也不知道有没有调包。	The delivery came in this condition, not only was the packaging crushed, the packaging of the electrical appliance was also open, I don't even know if there was a switch of goods.	yes
FYI	FYI	yes
还没有试用，一贯信赖飞利浦，希望电池寿命比其它牌子要长一些。	Haven't tried it yet, always trust Philips, hope the battery life is longer than other brands.	yes

买到别人拆开过的	Bought something that has been opened by others.	yes
三百多的机器要一百多的税确实比较高，看现在再六百多心里平衡多了。	The tax of over a hundred for a machine worth over three hundred is indeed high, but seeing it now at over six hundred makes me feel much more balanced.	yes
收到的时候封口胶条状态看着就很不对，像是拆开过，赶紧先拍了照，果然一撕就开了，打开后里面的纸板还有损坏，担心是别人退的，还没到纪念日就赶紧先给老公试试了，结果机器一点电都没有，还好刀头里面没有胡渣，要不大老远的咋退啊！	When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape looked very wrong, as if it had been opened. I quickly took a picture, and sure enough, it opened as soon as I tore it. After opening it, the cardboard inside was also damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I hurriedly let my husband try it before the anniversary. As a result, the machine had no power at all, luckily there was no stubble inside the blade, otherwise how would I return it from so far away!	yes
好不好用或者短期会不会有什么问题还未知，如前面的评价，缺货时发出的东西确实不靠谱！	Whether it's good to use or if there will be any problems in the short term is still unknown. As the previous reviews said, the items sent out when out of stock are indeed unreliable!	yes
体验感中偏上水平	The experience is above average.	yes
差不多顶级电动了，有很多种洁牙模式，但是很少人会天天换不同模式刷吧。	It's almost top-of-the-line electric, with many different tooth cleaning modes, but few people would change modes every day.	yes

刷头配件在亚马逊买同样便宜。	Brush head accessories are just as cheap on Amazon.	yes
App有点难用，除了改一下颜色那些，其他貌似兼容的问题是海外版的原因？	The app is a bit difficult to use, other than changing colors and such, it seems the compatibility issue is due to the overseas version?	yes
希望学学大法的。	Hope to learn from the greats.	yes
性价比很高	The cost-performance ratio is very high.	yes

综上，非常成功的一次购买。	In conclusion, this was a very successful purchase.	yes
有假货	There are counterfeits.	yes
上次买了两包，居然是两种不同的版本，本来包装上左下角的字是绿色的，结果有一包就不是，是白色的字，结果猫猫吃了就拉肚子了。	I bought two packs last time, and they turned out to be two different versions. Originally, the words in the lower left corner of the package were green, but one of the packs was not, it had white words. As a result, my cat had diarrhea after eating it.	yes
是亚马逊的货源是假的，还是发货时被员工掉包，我确定不了。	I can't determine whether the source of goods from Amazon is fake, or if the goods were switched by the staff during delivery.	yes
我会再买一次，如果还是假货，我就要找你们相关人士追责了。	I will buy it again, and if it is still counterfeit, I will hold your relevant personnel accountable.	yes
是横杠的！	It's a horizontal bar!	yes
亚马逊图片上是斜杠的，结果给我发来是横杠的，这不是骗人吗?	The picture on Amazon shows a slash, but what they sent me is a horizontal bar, isn't this deceiving?	yes
效果还行	The effect is okay.	yes
猫猫喜欢吃，这是重点。	The cat likes to eat, this is the key point.	yes
也确实有效果。	It indeed works.	yes
紧、窄，箍脚、磨脚背。	Tight, narrow, binding feet, rubbing the top of the foot.	yes
不推荐。	Not recommended.	yes
1.UN是clarks最舒服的系列，可惜这款太差了。	1. UN is the most comfortable series of Clarks, but it's a pity that this model is too bad.	yes
追加：今天对比了以前的UN系列鞋垫（鞋扔了垫留着用），材质比以前差了不少，弹性不如以前，透气也不如以前，就是假假的软。	Addendum: Today I compared it with the previous UN series shoe pads (I threw away the shoes but kept the pads), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it's just falsely soft.	yes
2.我的脚背不算高，硌的部位在脚背最高处向前3公分左右。	2. My foot arch is not high, the part that rubs is about 3 centimeters forward from the highest point of the foot arch.	yes
3.海外购买了三双clarks，只有一双合适。	3. I bought three pairs of Clarks overseas, only one pair fits.	yes
吓得我把收藏夹里的其乐都删了。	I was so scared that I deleted all the Clarks from my favorites.	yes
回头试试rockport，不行只能去ecco实体店了。	I'll try Rockport next, if it doesn't work, I'll have to go to the ECCO physical store.	yes
以次充好，品控不好	The quality control is poor, substituting inferior for good.	yes
首先，值得肯定的是Prime海外购Ups很给力，31号下的单6号就收到了。	Firstly, it's worth acknowledging that Prime Overseas Purchase Ups is very efficient, I placed the order on the 31st and received it on the 6th.	yes
鞋子颜色比图片好看很多，皮质感觉不错。	The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.	yes
鞋码稍大一点点，25脚长10.5宽拍的7.5W，上脚稍微有点宽松，不过平时就喜欢穿宽松一点，垫一双鞋垫刚好。	The shoe size is a little bit larger, with a foot length of 25 and a width of 10.5, I ordered 7.5W, it's a bit loose when worn, but I usually like to wear it a bit loose, it's just right with a pair of insoles.	yes
其次，这个鞋子品控真的不敢恭维，一只鞋底胶有破损，另外一只鞋面有各种擦痕还有个针眼，鞋面与鞋底连接处胶条错位，明摆着的以次充好！	Secondly, the quality control of these shoes is really disappointing, one shoe sole is damaged, the other shoe has various scratches and a pinhole, the glue strip at the connection between the shoe upper and the shoe sole is misplaced, it's obviously substituting inferior for good!	yes
有点后悔！	A bit regretful!	yes
做活动280块买到的，这个价格买到亚瑟士相当划算，当然看评论还有更低的价格。	I bought it for 280 yuan during a promotion, which is quite a bargain for Asics at this price, of course, there are lower prices in the reviews.	yes
现在说一下鞋子，优点：鞋子很轻，跑步挺舒服，也比较合脚，不会松松垮垮的。	Now let's talk about the shoes, pros: the shoes are very light, comfortable for running, and fit well, they won't be loose.	yes
颜值很高但缺点也很明显：我一般穿40的鞋，这次买的40.5的，穿进去鞋子前端大概还有1个大拇指的距离，但是，这并不影响什么。	They look great but the cons are also obvious: I usually wear size 40 shoes, this time I bought size 40.5, there's about a thumb's width of space in the front of the shoe, but this doesn't affect anything.	yes
这鞋很“窄”，虽然前面还留着距离，但是感觉紧紧的。	The shoes are quite "narrow", even though there's space in the front, they feel tight.	yes
还有一点，鞋子透气可能不太好，现在穿感觉脚很热。	Another point, the shoes might not be very breathable, my feet feel hot wearing them now.	yes
压脚背	Pressing on the instep	yes
首先鞋子做工很好，值这个价。	First of all, the shoes are very well made and worth the price.	yes
我的脚是很标准那种，跑鞋uk7.5,eu41.5,皮鞋uk6.5,亚马逊的爱步也买过几双，从来没有出现过不合脚，但是这双我参照评论，买大一号uk7,上脚后因为大了一码长度明显偏长，但因为鞋垫太厚，还是压脚背压的厉害，加上徒步鞋非常硬，导致上脚非常难受。	My feet are very standard, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, I have bought several pairs of Aibu from Amazon, and I have never had a problem with them not fitting, but this pair I referred to the comments, bought a larger size uk7, after putting them on because they are one size larger the length is obviously too long, but because the insole is too thick, it still presses hard on the instep, plus the walking shoes are very hard, making them very uncomfortable to wear.	yes
如果你的脚不是特别瘦那种，不推荐购买这款。	If your feet are not particularly thin, I do not recommend buying this model.	yes
如果一定要买，换个鞋垫也能解决，但是原配鞋垫看起来很高级的样子，不用又可惜。	If you must buy, changing the insole can solve the problem, but the original insole looks very high-end, it's a pity not to use it.	yes
非常完美的一次购物！	A perfect shopping experience!	yes
非常满意，非常喜欢，亚马逊海外购都是正品毋庸置疑，质量也非常好，物美价廉，买的放心，售后服务很周到，客服态度都很亲切和蔼，处理问题耐心高效，完美解决后顾之忧，配套的快递送货上门非常便捷稳妥，送货师傅很替顾客着想，每次都会提醒及时从快递柜中取货，感谢亚马逊给顾客提供如此舒适的购物体验。	Very satisfied, very fond of it, Amazon overseas purchases are undoubtedly genuine, the quality is also very good, good value for money, rest assured to buy, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very kind and amiable, handling problems patiently and efficiently, perfectly solving worries, the accompanying express delivery to the door is very convenient and secure, the delivery master always thinks for the customers, always reminds to pick up from the express cabinet in time, thank Amazon for providing such a comfortable shopping experience to customers.	yes

Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall good?	yes
再说一下包装，就是用保鲜膜包了几层，里面连个包装塑料泡泡纸都没有，打开一看，所有的零件就放在空荡荡的盒子里，还好玩具质量不错，没有坏掉的零件，就是比想象中的小太多了，因为不是带电池的，手推着经常脱轨，感觉轨道两边空隙太大，设计不合理。	Speaking of the packaging, it was just wrapped in a few layers of cling film, without any bubble wrap inside. When I opened it, all the parts were just lying in the empty box. Thankfully, the quality of the toy is good and there were no broken parts. However, it's much smaller than I imagined.

我联系厂家问手表在入库有核对时间吗?他们回复说“有”，既然有，那为啥时间相差那么多，那肯定是手表没有精确度，简单地说就是水货产品，不是我说的难听，看嘛，很明显的质量问题（数字显示不完全）都拿出来卖，是不是垃圾货。	I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watches were checked for the correct time when they were stored. They replied "yes". If so, why is there such a big difference in time? It's clear that the watches are not accurate, simply put, they are inferior products.

很满意的手表	A very satisfying watch.	yes
肯定是正品，去专柜验过货，表的外观很漂亮，做工精细，用料足，加上又是进口机械机芯，所以是有一定的分量的，是那些三四百所谓的机械表不能比的，这个是货真价实的。	It's definitely genuine, I had it verified at the counter. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the craftsmanship is fine, the materials used are substantial, and it has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It's incomparable to those so-called mechanical watches that cost three or four hundred. This one is truly worth its price.	yes
表的走时是很准的，误差完全在可接受范围内，表的包装里有珠宝鉴定证书，表盘的12字那里是真钻石，这个自己戴很合适，作为礼品送出去也很有面子。	The watch keeps time very accurately, the error is completely within an acceptable range.

9月23日晚上老婆手机摔了，心血来潮立马来亚马逊订购了一台8p，有货但是不是自营的且没有加价（心里暗喜），由于不是自营的发货比较慢，系统显示预计最晚收货要到9月27日。	On the evening of September 23, my wife's phone broke, and on a whim, I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon. It was in stock but not self-operated and there was no price increase (I was secretly pleased). Because it was not self-operated, the delivery was slow, and the system showed that the latest delivery would be on September 27.	yes
老婆没手机用难受死了，第二天一早6点多叫我在想想办法，后来上京东一看256G有货可以当天送到，只得立马再订购一台。	My wife was very uncomfortable without a phone, so early the next morning at 6 o'clock, she asked me to think of a solution.

好吧，我就耐心的等着，到了中午上手机一看，订单还在状态还处于未发货，就立马联系客服要求赶快取消订单，客服答复已经操作OK。	Well, I waited patiently. At noon, I checked my phone and saw that the order was still there and had not been shipped.

买来之后其他的都没什么问题，就是在软件连接的时候，怎么都连不上，我家是TP的路由器，上网查了之后发现好多人都有这个问题，弄了两个多小时，各种改路由器的设置，最后我用360WIFI作为媒介给弄好的，期间给小米客服打电话，他们对这个问题也没有什么解决方法，直接就让我联系亚马逊进行售后。	After buying it, there were no other problems, but when connecting the software, I couldn't connect at all. My home uses a TP router. After searching online, I found that many people have this problem. I spent more than two hours changing various router settings.

During this time, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have any solutions to this problem, they just told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.	yes
另外一点值得注意的就是我在网上看到用户的评论说，这个摄像头支持的存储卡最小是8G，存储容量更小的就不能识别，希望大家注意这点。	Another point worth noting is that I saw user comments online saying that the smallest storage card this camera supports is 8G. It can't recognize storage with smaller capacity, so please pay attention to this.	yes

描述 (DESCRIPTION) C 和 C++ 编译器是集成的.他们都要用四个步骤中的一个或多个处理输入文件: 预处理(preprocessing), Hii(compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking) .	DESCRIPTION C and C++ compilers are integrated. They all handle input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.	yes
源文件后级名标识源文件的语言, 但是对编译器来说, 后绥名控制着缺省设定:	The source file suffix identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix name controls the default setting:	yes
gcc 认为预处理后的文件(.i) 是 c 文件, 并且设定 c 形式的连接，	gcc considers the preprocessed file ((.i) to be a c file and sets the connection to be in the form of c,	yes
g++ 认为预处理后的文件 (.i) 是 c++ 文件 ,并且设定 c++ 形式的连接.	g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c++ file and sets the connection to the c++ form.	yes
源文件后级名指出语言种类以及后期的操作:	The source file suffix indicates the language type and the operation in the later stages:	yes

汇编语言源程序; 预处理,汇编	Compilation of source language programs; preprocessing, compilation and assembly	no
.h 预处理器文件; 通常不出现在命令行上其他后级名的文件被传递给连接器 (Linker).通常包括:	.h preprocessor files; files that do not normally appear on the command line with other suffixes are passed to the linker. Typically include:	no
.0 目标文件 (Object file)	.0 Object file	no
.a 归档库文件(Archive file)	The archive file is a file that contains the information about the author of the book.	no
除非使用了 -cec，-s, 或 -E 选项(或者编译错误阻止了完整的过程),否则连接总是最后的步骤.	Connection is always the last step, unless the -cec-, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the entire process).	no
在连接阶段中,所有对应于源程序的.e 文件，-1 库文件, 无法识别的文件名(包括指定的.o H 标文件和 .a 库文件)按命令行中的顺序传递给连接器选项 (OPTIONS)	At the connection stage, all corresponding.e files, -1 library files, unidentified file names ((including the specified.o H flag files and.a library files) are passed to the connector options in order from the command line	no
选项必须分立给出 : de ' 完全不同于 `-d -r '.	The option must be given separately: de'is completely different from `-d-r '.	no
大多数 ` -=E :和 `-W' 选项有两个相反的格式 : -fname 和 -fno-name (或 -Wname 和 -Wno- name).	Most ` -=E: and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).	no
这里只列举不是默认选项的格式.	The format is not the default, but is listed here.	no
下面是所有选项的摘要, 按类型分组, 解释放在后面的章节中.	Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in later chapters.	no
代码生成选项 (Code Generation Option)	Code generation option	yes
总体选项 (Overall Option)	Overall option	yes
明确指出后面输入文件的语言为 language (而不是从文件名后绥得到的默认选择).	Specify that the language of the file to be entered afterwards is language (rather than the default option from the file name suffix).	yes
这个选项应用于后面所有的输入文件, 直到遇着下一个 `-x' 选项 .language 的可选	This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option is encountered.	yes
关闭任何对语种的明确说明, 因此依据文件名后级处理后面的文件 RE AS E ` -x' 选项).	Turn off any language explicit, so the file is processed according to the file name suffix (RE AS E ` -x' option).	yes
如果只操作四个阶段( 预处理, 编译, 汇编, 连接)中的一部分, 可以使用 ` -x' 选项 (或文件名后 Ah) 告诉 geo 从哪里开始,用 `~-c' ，`-s' ,或 `-E' 选项告诉 geo 到哪里结束.注意,某些选项组合 (例如 ，`-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c 编译或汇编源文件, ETER. ERA ATI 缺省情况下， GCC 通过用 ` .o' 蔡换源文件名后级 ` .ec 标文件名. 可以使用-o 选项选择其他名字.GCC忽略 -ec 选项后面任何无法识别的输入文伯 -S F 何事情.	If only a portion of the four stages (Preprocess, Compile, Compile, Connect) is operated, the ` -x' option (or Ah after the filename) can be used to tell geo where to start, and the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (e.g., `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or compile source files, ETER. In the absence of ERA ATI, GCC is used by `.o' to replace the source file name with the post-level `.ec filename. Other options can be used to choose the name.	yes
了的目标文件.	The targeted files.	yes
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	The compilation is stopped and no compilation is done.	yes
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	The compiler for GNU does not have this problem, since the compilers for those systems cannot read data from the pipeline, and the compiler is able to accept the C "dialect": support for C programs that conform to the ANSI standard.	yes
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This turns off certain keywords in GNU Cc that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, as well as ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax that are indicated as acceptable and rarely used, and disables them despite the fact that they are used in all standard libraries. The main function returns an int value, typical of almost all programs except the kernel.	yes
对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', C-style handling --- i.e. no indication of the number or type of parameters. (Only for C++).	no
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	Normally, a function like foo would mean that the argument is empty in C++.	no
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	The section lists here are removed to try to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.	no
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	We have removed the details so that when the content is out of date, people won't be able to HERI it.	no
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the '∀ -traditional' option brings an additional effect, allowing this to be assigned.	no
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	The result of this is the same as the result of the '`-Ethis-is-variable' option.	no
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.	no
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	In particular, the preprocessor mentioned above, but not including the other effects of the '`-traditional' option.	no
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the character `$' in identifiers (C++ only).	no
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	You can specify the option '∀-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' to explicitly prohibit the use of the '∀$' character.	no
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	(GNU C++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not all.)	no
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of the ant type to the enumeration type (MEF c++).	no
正常情况下 GNU C++ 允许从 enum 到 int 的转换,反之则不行.	In normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows the conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.	no
-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	-fexternal-templates generates a smaller code (limited to c++) for the template declaration, by generating a copy of each template function only where they are defined.	no
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementatio' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use the template.	no
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	When a program compiles with `-fexternal-templates', all template instantiations are external types. You must have the required instances appear in the implementation file.	no
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	This can be done through typedef, which cites each instance as needed.	no
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	Correspondingly, if the default option ` -fno-exteznal-templates' is used when compiling, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.	no
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All member functions (except the constructor subfunction and the mnew or delete member operator) are treated as virtual functions of the class in which they are located.	no
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	This does not imply that every call to a member function will pass through the internal null table.	no
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; this is called directly.	no
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch Allows type mismatch of the second and third parameters of a conditional expression.	no
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-is-variable allowing this to be assigned (only for c++).	no
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	The incorporation of user-customized free storage management mechanisms into c++ makes the attributable '`this' seem out of date.	no
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	Therefore, by default, this assignment is invalid inside the class member function.	no
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	However, for backwards compatibility, you can enable this by using the '`-fthis-is-variable' option.	no
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	-funsigned-char Defines char as a symbolless type, like unsigned char.	no
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Each machine has its own default char type. It can be either an unsigned char or a signed char.	no
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the symbolic nature of the data.	no
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	But many programs have been written using only simple char, and the terminal block is either symmetrical (or symmetricalless, depending on the target machine that wrote the program).	no
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This option, and its antiderivative, allows the program to work on the corresponding default.	no
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	The type of char should always be clearly defined as a signed char or an unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.	no
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	If there is no explicit declaration of the ` signed' or "unsigned' modifier, these options are used to define a bitfield with or without a symbol.	no
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	By default, bit fields are signed because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed, however, if the '`-traditional' option is specified, the bit fields are always unsigned.	no
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	-fwritable-strings stores string constants in a writable data segment, and does not give it special treatment.	no
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	This is to make it compatible with some older programs, which are thinking that changing the string constant is a very bad idea, and the '`-traditional' option has the same effect.	no

贩运者由于旅行限制而无法越境，可能不得不寻找新的路线和方法。	Traffickers who cannot cross the border due to travel restrictions may have to find new routes and methods.	yes
毒品使用和提供的模式可能会改变，政府的应对能力也可能会受到阻碍。	The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hindered.	yes
新冠肺炎带来的转变是前所未有的，但还是可以从以往的危机中吸取一些经验教训。	The transformation of the coronavirus is unprecedented, but there are lessons to be learned from past crises.	yes
2008年经济危机后，一些吸毒者开始寻找更便宜的合成物质，使用模式转向注射毒品。	After the 2008 economic crisis, some users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances and shifted their patterns of use to injecting drugs.	no
与此同时，各国政府削减了与毒品相关的预算。	At the same time, governments have cut budgets related to drugs.	no
如果各国政府以同样的方式应对当前的经济衰退，预防吸毒和相关风险行为等干预措施和戒毒治疗服务可能会受到沉重打击。	Interventions such as prevention of drug use and related risk behaviors and drug treatment services could be hit hard if governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way.	no
此外，拦截行动和国际合作的优先性可能会降低，使贩运者更容易行动。	In addition, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to act.	no
一些国家有大量毒品通过商业航班走私，预计这些国家的贩毒活动受到的直接影响最大。	The report also highlights the fact that the number of countries where drugs are smuggled via commercial airlines is high, and that these countries are expected to be the most directly affected by the drug trafficking activity.	no
有信使将甲基苯丙胺等合成毒品放在随身背包或藏在私人行李中携带，有时数量很大。由于几乎各地都对航空客运实施了限制，利用商业航空旅行供应毒品的活动可能会完全中断。	Consumers have been known to carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their backpacks or hidden in their personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Due to restrictions on air passenger transportation in almost all places, the supply of drugs using commercial air travel may be completely interrupted.	no
尽管国际邮政供应链也受到了干扰，但利用暗网和货物邮寄进行贩运的活动可能会增加。	Although the international postal supply chain is also affected, the use of darknet and cargo mail for trafficking activities may increase.	no
从长远来看，经济衰退和相关的封闭措施可能会打乱毒品市场。	In the long run, the economic recession and related closures could disrupt the drug market.	no
由于不断上升的失业率和缺乏机会，贫困和弱势人群将更有可能以有害的方式吸毒，患上吸毒病症，并转向与毒品有关的非法活动一无论是生产还是运输。	Due to rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, to develop drug addiction disorders, and to turn to illicit activities related to drugs, whether in production or transportation.	no
贩毒组织可能会利用这种情况，向脆弱人群提供服务，并招募新成员来壮大队伍。	The drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable populations and recruit new members to strengthen their ranks.	no
随着政府应对能力的降低，这些转变可能会快速扎根，成为许多社区的新现实。	These changes could quickly take root and become a new reality in many communities as the government's ability to respond declines.	no

世界各地的吸毒现象一直在增多，无论是从总体数字还是从吸毒者在世界人口中所占比例来看都是如此。	Drug use has been increasing in all parts of the world, both in terms of overall numbers and in terms of the proportion of drug users in the world's population.	no
2009年估计吸毒者有2.1亿人，占全球15-64岁人口的4.8%,而2018年估计吸毒者有2.69亿人，占这类人口的5.3%。	In 2009, an estimated 210 million people used drugs, or 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, compared to an estimated 269 million in 2018, or 5.3% of the population.	no
在过去二十年期间，发展中国家吸毒情况的增长速度远远快于发达国家。	Over the past two decades, drug use in developing countries has increased much faster than in developed countries.	no
这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。	This reflects to some extent the difference in overall population growth over this period, with 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.	no
青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。	The largest proportion of drug users are adolescents and young adults.	no
在2000-2018年期间，发展中国家这一年龄段的人口增长了16%,而发达国家这一年龄段的人口减少了10%。	Between 2000 and 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.	no
1城市化是当前和未来毒品市场的一个驱动因素	1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets	no
无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。	In both developed and developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas.	no
吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。	The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the massive migration of people from rural to urban areas, where more than half of the world's population now lives, compared to 34% in 1960.	no
城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。	Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more prominent.	no
财富的增加与吸毒情况增多相联，但承受疾病负担最大的是最贫穷的人在世界范围内，发达国家的吸毒情况比发展中国家更为普遍。	Increasing wealth is associated with an increase in drug use, but the burden of disease is greatest among the poorest people in the world, and drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.	no
可卡因之类的毒品更是与世界上较富裕的地区联系较为牢固。	The drug is also linked to the richest parts of the world, where it is used in the production of drugs such as cocaine.	no
同样，在各国内部，社会富裕阶层的吸毒流行率较高。	In the same way, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the wealthy in different countries.	no
但转为吸毒病症的比率较高的却是社会经济地位较低的人。	However, the highest rates of drug addiction are found in people with lower socioeconomic status.	no
来自少数几个国家的数据表明，有害的吸毒模式与病症同低收入之间存在联系。	Data from a small number of countries show a link between harmful patterns of drug use, disease and low income.	no
这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。	These patterns seem less common in the wealthier social classes.	no
全球新冠肺炎危机造成的经济制约很可能会加剧包括吸毒者在内的最弱势群体的风险。	The economic constraints caused by the global coronavirus pneumonia crisis are likely to increase the risk for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.	no
例如，劳动力市场的变化，如失业率上升，过去一直与吸毒情况的增加有关，而这场疫情己经迫使全球数千万人失业。	For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked in the past to an increase in drug use, an epidemic that has already forced tens of millions of people around the world out of work.	no
新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。	The pandemic of coronavirus pneumonia could lead to more farmers or illegal crop cultivation, or because of the reduced control capacity of the state authorities, or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities under the economic crisis.	no
新冠肺炎的相关限制措施导致空中和陆路交通减少，海上贩运可能已经因此而增加，海上的拦截风险低，而且比空中或陆路走私的数量更多。	The associated restrictions on coronavirus pneumonia have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, which may have increased maritime trafficking, with a lower risk of interception at sea and more trafficking than by air or land.	no
最近已有报告称可卡因货物直接从南美经由海路运往欧洲。	Recently, there have been reports of cocaine being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.	no
复杂性增强	Increased complexity	yes
非国际管制物质的出现情况稳定，但有潜在危害的新型类阿片正在增多毒品市场正日趋复杂。	The emergence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but the market for potentially harmful new opioids is growing and becoming more complex.	yes
除大麻、可卡因和海洛因等植物类物质之外，已经增添了数百种合成毒品，其中许多并不在国际管制之下。药品的非医疗使用也快速增多。	In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. Non-medical use of drugs is also growing rapidly.	yes
会员国的国内市场每年约有500种新型活性物质。	The domestic market of the Member States is home to approximately 500 new active substances per year.	yes
目前其中大多是兴奋剂，其次是合成的大麻素受体激动剂和少量的类阿片。	Currently, the majority of these are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor activators and a small number of opioids.	yes
虽然新型精神活性物质的总体数量已经稳定下来，但比例发生了变化。	Although the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.	yes
在2014年确定的新型精神活性物质种类总数中，类阿片新型精神活性物质仅占2%,但到2018年，这一数字己上升至9%。	Opioid-like new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2% of the total number of new psychoactive substance categories identified in 2014, but this figure rose to 9% by 2018 [2].	yes
类阿片新型精神活性物质中有许多是芬太尼的类似物，其药效和危害已得到证明，在北美导致了过量死亡事件，其他区域也有，但程度较轻。	Many of the newer psychoactive substances, such as opioids, are analogues of fentanyl, whose medicinal effects and harms have been demonstrated to cause overdose deaths in North America and other regions, but to a lesser degree.	yes
在北美，芬太尼有的用作海洛因和其他毒品（包括可卡因和甲基苯丙胺）的掺杂剂，有的用来制造假冒的药用类阿片。	In North America, fentanyl is used as a hallucinogen for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and in the manufacture of counterfeit medicinal opiates.	yes
一些证据表明，欧洲也有注射新型精神活性物质兴奋剂的现象：一项对欧洲六个城市废弃注射器残留物的研宄发现，许多注射器都沾有产生兴奋作用的新型精神活性物质》	Some evidence suggests that injection of new psychoactive substances (NPS) is also a phenomenon in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were laced with the new psychoactive substance, mercury, which produces an exciting effect	yes
2新型精神活性物质的使用可能会逐渐牢固存在于弱势群体中	2 The use of new psychoactive substances may become more entrenched in vulnerable groups	no
单一种类的新型精神活性物质几乎从未形成大的市场。	The market for a single class of novel psychoactive substances has hardly ever been large.	no
但来自欧洲的证据表明，合成大麻素在无家可归者和监狱囚犯等社会边缘群体中是一个严重的问题。	But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabis is a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.	no
有22个国家报告了监狱中使用新型精神活性物质的情况，其中大多数国家将合成大麻素确定为主要挑战。	Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with the majority of countries identifying synthetic cannabis as the main challenge.	no
对前体化学品的管制迫使制毒者进行创新最常作为前体用来合成苯丙胺、甲基苯丙胺和“摇头丸”等毒品的许多化学品已被置于国际管制之下。	The regulation of precursor chemicals has forced drug makers to innovate, and many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as ketamine, methylamine and methamphetamine have been placed under international control.	no
贩毒者和制毒者一直在寻找替代品一不仅有管制较松的物质，还有专门为规避管制而设计的化学品，即所谓的“特制前体”。	Drug dealers and manufacturers have been looking for alternatives to not only loosely regulated substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to circumvent regulation, the so-called "special-purpose" precursors.	no
旨在阻止新冠肺炎传播的限制性措施很可能使依赖前体化学品的制毒者受到进一步挤压。	Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia are likely to further squeeze out poisoners who rely on precursor chemicals.	no
来自墨西哥的证据表明，这已经成为 现实：据报告，2020年3月，从东亚进口的甲基苯丙胺前体短缺促使墨西哥和美国的甲基苯丙胺价格上涨。	Evidence from Mexico suggests that this is already a reality: in March 2020, it was reported that a shortage of methylamine precursors imported from East Asia had led to higher prices in Mexico and the United States.	no
市场瞬息万变	The market is changing	no
合成药物在中亚和俄罗斯联邦取代阿片剂	Synthetic drugs replace opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation	no
中亚和俄罗斯联邦的阿片剂市场在2008年至2018年期间似乎发生了变化。	The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.	no
俄罗斯联邦当局截获的阿片剂数量下降了约80%，同时因使用类阿片而接受治疗的人数大幅减少。	The number of opioids seized by the Russian Federation authorities has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has decreased significantly.	no
但兴奋剂市场却似乎日渐兴旺。	But the market for stimulants seems to be booming.	no

早在2012年，对医院、监狱和其他机构人员的调查就已经揭示了甲基苯丙胺在伊拉克的重要性。	As early as 2012, investigations of hospital, prison and other staff revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.	no
结晶甲基苯丙胺已经成为“芬乃他林”和曲马多之外又一种令人担忧的主要药物。	Crystalline methamphetamine has become a major drug of concern alongside benzodiazepines and quetiapine.	no
2015年的一项研宄进一步证实了这些发现，吸毒者表示大麻比“芬乃他林”或甲基苯丙胺更难获得。	A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with users reporting that cannabis is more difficult to obtain than methamphetamine or methylphenidate.	no
最近，伊拉克当局发现了多个甲基苯丙胺加工点，麻管局已对伪麻黄碱制剂的大批进口表示关切一甲基苯丙胺加工点将这些制剂用作前体。	Recently, Iraqi authorities discovered several methamphetamine processing sites, and the Anesthesia Control Board has expressed concern over the large-scale import of pseudo-methamphetamine preparations, which are used as precursors in one methamphetamine processing site.	no
在阿富汗，甲基苯丙胺制造似乎始于2014年。	In Afghanistan, the manufacture of methamphetamine appears to have started in 2014.	no

但2019年上半年的缉获量一^657公斤——与上一年相比大幅骤增。	However, the first half of 2019 saw a sharp increase of 657 kg of manganese compared to the previous year.	no
在其他国家大量缉获了据认为源自阿富汗的甲基苯丙胺，这也表明该国的产量正在迅速上升。	The large quantities of methamphetamine seized in other countries, which are believed to be of Afghan origin, also indicate that production in the country is rising rapidly.	no
政策变化和变化趋势	Policy changes and trends	yes
非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域大多有大麻使用增多的趋势	Most jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical use of cannabis have seen an increase in its use.	yes
加拿大、乌拉圭和美国的11个法域允许制造大麻产品供非医疗使用。	The manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use is permitted in 11 jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States.	yes
在其中多数法域，大麻使用自合法化以来有所增多，尽管在其他未将非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域也观察到了同样的趋势。	In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical use of cannabis.	yes
在美国最早通过立法的两个州科罗拉多州和华盛顿州，成年人非医疗使用大麻的情况增加，特别是过去一个月以及每天或几乎每天使用的情况增多，自2012年起便已超过了全国平均水平。	In the first two states to pass legislation, Colorado and Washington, non-medical use of marijuana by adults has increased, especially in the past month, and daily or near-daily use has exceeded the national average since 2012.	yes
所有指标都显示，自2011年以来，乌拉圭的大麻使用情况有所增加，上月使用情况几乎翻了一番。	All indicators show that the use of cannabis in Uruguay has increased since 2011, with the use almost doubling last month.	yes
这表明增加的主要原因是经常和频繁使用大麻。	This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the frequent and frequent use of cannabis.	yes

然而，2019年仍有40%的大麻使用者靠非法来源获得某些产品。	However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources.	yes
全球大麻药草缉获量暴跌的背后原因是大麻合法化？	Is legalization the reason behind the global plunge in cannabis seeds?	yes
2018年，全球大麻药草缉获量降至20年来的最低水平，这是因为北美的缉获量下降，在过去10年中下降了 84%。	In 2018, global cannabis straw harvests fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a decline in harvests in North America, which has declined by 84% over the past 10 years.	no
相比之下，同期世界其他地区的缉获量几乎翻了一番。缉获的模式表明，旨在放开大麻市场的政策在下降中发挥了关键作用。	In comparison, seizures in the rest of the world nearly doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at opening up the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.	no
对新型精神活性物质的监管似乎有遏制作用在国内对新型精神活性物质的监管效果仍然很难评估。	The effectiveness of the regulation of new psychoactive substances in the country is still difficult to assess.	no
一些对新型精神活性物质采用不同监管制度的国家显示出不同的新型精神活性物质使用流行率。	Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different rates of new psychoactive substance use.	no

据估计，低收入和中等收入国家的人口占全球人口的88%,但消费的药用类阿片却不到10%。	It is estimated that 88% of the world's population lives in low- and middle-income countries, but less than 10% of the world's population consumes medicinal opioids.	no
获取药用类阿片的障碍与许多因素有关，包括立法、文化、卫生系统和处方做法。	Barriers to access to prescription opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.	no
较贫穷的人患吸毒病症的风险更大2018年约有3,560万人患有吸毒病症。	Poorer people are at greater risk of developing drug-related diseases, with 35.6 million people suffering from drug-related diseases in 2018.	no
贫困、有限的教育和社会边缘化可能会增加吸毒病症风险，并加剧其后果。高收入国家的研宄证实了这一点，在这些研究中，个人不利的社会经济轨迹一不仅仅是他们在某一时间点的状况一也与吸毒病症风险有关。	Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. Research in high-income countries confirms this, and in these studies, the socioeconomic trajectories of individuals that are disadvantaged are associated with the risk of drug use disorders, not just their situation at a particular point in time.	no
吸毒病症还会加深社会经济劣势，进一步增加失业、贫困和无家可归的风险，从而助长劣势的恶性循环。这些结果也可能与刑事司法系统内的侮辱性态度和后果有关。	Drug use disorders also exacerbate socioeconomic disadvantages, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thus contributing to the vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to the stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.	no
妇女、少数民族和移民、性取向多样化群体、因武装冲突或灾难而流离失所的人以及农村环境中的人也可能受到吸毒病症的过重影响，或者在获得治疗服务方面遇到问题。	Women, minorities and migrants, diverse groups of sexual orientation, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug-related illnesses or have problems accessing treatment services.	no

毒品和暴力之间的关系错综复杂很难确定精神活性物质的使用和暴力之间的所有因果关系。	The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.	no
全球范围的有限数据表明，迷醉可能是杀人的一个重要因素。	Limited data from around the world suggests that binge drinking may be a significant factor in deaths.	no
但在暴力事件中，酒精的作用似乎比毒品更大。	But alcohol seems to be more important than drugs in violence.	no
虽然吸毒可能会导致犯罪，但在某些情况下，这种联系可以部分归因于多种中介因素，如社会经济劣势以及由个人风险、家庭环境和同龄人影响造成的其他类型的逆境。	While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases this link can be attributed in part to a variety of intermediate factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment and peer influence.	no
贩毒和暴力之间的联系是多方面的。	The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.	no
如果已有稳定的犯罪结构，包括国际贩毒在内的大规模有组织犯罪活动有可能在无暴力的情况下实施。	Where there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, is likely to be carried out in a non-violent manner.	no
短期内，暴力的存在和程度与其说取决于贩运的数量，不如说取决于造成有组织犯罪集团之间力量平衡不稳定的某些变化，例如非法市场规模的变化，知名罪犯的死亡或监禁，以及使一个集团弱于另一个集团的执法措施。	In the short term, the presence and extent of violence depends less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or incarceration of known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group over another.	no
最新趋势	The latest trends	yes
吸毒大麻是最常用的物质，类阿片危害最大	Marijuana is the most commonly used drug, and opioids are the most harmful	yes
据估计，2018年使用大麻的有 1.92 亿人，使之成为全球使用最多的毒品。	It is estimated that in 2018, there were 189 million people who used cannabis, making it the most used drug in the world.	yes
相比之下，2018年使用类阿片的有5,800万人。	In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.	yes
但阿片类药物的相关危害却因使用者较少而受到忽视。	The dangers of opioids are being ignored because of the low number of users.	yes
在2017年与吸毒病症有关的估计167,000例死亡中，有66%是这类物质造成的，在据信为吸毒导致的残疾或过早死亡而损失的2,100万年寿命中，有50%是这类物质造成的。	Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and 50% of the 21 million years of life lost in the United States are believed to be due to disability or premature death caused by drug use.	yes
合成类阿片的非医疗使用加剧了公共卫生危机	Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis	yes
在西非、中部非洲和北非，加剧类阿片危机的是曲马多；在北美则是芬太尼。这两个区域在经济、人口统计数据或一般吸毒模式方面几乎没有共同点，但都在奋力抗击由容易获得且生产成本低的物质助长的类阿片危机。	In West, Central and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Kumamoto; in North America, it is Fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economics, demographics or general patterns of drug use, but are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by the availability and low cost of the substance.	yes
在北美，芬太尼等合成类阿片的使用导致了20年来类阿片过量致死人数增加。	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.	yes
2018年，在美国登记的67,367例过量死亡中，有三分之二涉及芬太尼。	In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths reported in the United States were related to fentanyl.	yes
加拿大也报告了类似的结果，只是数字较低。	Canada reports similar results, but with lower numbers.	no
芬太尼导致过量死亡的部分原因是非法药物市场上的芬太尼药效不可预测。	The unpredictability of fentanyl in the illicit drug market is partly responsible for fentanyl overdose deaths.	no
在西非、中部非洲和北非，非医疗用途曲马多的市场已有大幅增长。	The market for non-medical use of quinoa has grown significantly in West, Central and North Africa.	no
在该区域，接受治疗的曲马多使用病症患者越来越多。	In the region, treatment for the use of curcumin is increasingly being used by patients with the disease.	no
2017年，全球截获的曲马多数量显著增加，达到125吨以上的峰值。	In 2017, the global quantity of the Khumar has increased significantly, reaching a peak of over 125 tons.	no
但2018年，在印度通过一项监管曲马多的新法律之后，全球缉获量降至32吨。	But in 2018, global catches dropped to 32 tons after India passed a new law regulating the use of kumquats.	no
促成这两地危机的是制造简单和生产成本低，此外还有对曲马多和许多芬太尼类似物或其前体缺乏国际监管。	The two crises are due to the simplicity and low cost of manufacturing, as well as the lack of international regulation of Quimado and many of its Fentanyl analogues or precursors.	no
使这两地危机恶化的是这些物质在药品市场和非法市场上都有供应，因而更加难以发现和防止其滥用。	What makes the crisis worse is that these substances are available in both the drug and illicit markets, making it harder to detect and prevent their abuse.	no
兴奋剂使用不断增多	Increased Use of Stimulants	no
兴奋剂领域以可卡因和甲基苯丙胺为主，这两种物质在其主要市场的使用量都在上升。	The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasingly used in its main markets.	no
2018年使用可卡因的约有1,900万人，因为可卡因在北美和西欧颇为流行。	In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as cocaine became more popular in North America and Western Europe.	no
同年使用苯丙胺的约有2,700万人，其中甲基苯丙胺是东南亚和北美使用最多的苯丙胺类兴奋剂。	In the same year, around 27 million people used ketamine, with methylamine being the most commonly used ketamine stimulant in South East Asia and North America.	no
根据所掌握的多数指标，20年来这两个区域甲基苯丙胺的使用一直在扩大。	According to most indicators available, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding for 20 years.	no
在一些市场上，可卡因和甲基苯丙胺可以共存，有时是相互替代，这样一种药物的使用量上升时另一种药物的使用量就下降，有时是同时增加和减少以满足同一市场的需求。	In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine coexist, sometimes interchangeably, such that as the use of one drug increases, the use of the other drug decreases, sometimes simultaneously increasing and decreasing to meet the demands of the same market.	no
新冠肺炎使注射吸毒者的风险增高	Coronavirus pneumonia increases the risk of injecting drug users	no
据估计，2018年注射吸毒的约有1,130万人，全球艾滋病毒感染约有10%是注射吸毒造成的。	It is estimated that 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018 and that around 10% of HIV infections worldwide were caused by injecting drugs.	no
注射吸毒者感染艾滋病毒的超过100万人，患丙型肝炎的有550万人。	More than 1 million people injecting drugs are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million suffer from hepatitis C.	no
2017年，因吸毒死亡的约有 58.5万人，其中一半死于丙型肝炎引起的肝病，而注射吸毒者的丙型肝炎大多仍未得到治疗。	In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of them from hepatitis C-related liver disease, and most of the hepatitis C in injecting drug users remains untreated.	no
5 新冠肺炎限制措施造成的类阿片短缺可能导致使用者代之以酒精或苯二氮类药物等更容易获得的物质，或者将类阿片与合成药物混合。	5 Opioid shortages caused by restrictive measures for necrotizing pneumonia may lead users to substitute more easily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.	no
随着一些使用者改用注射或更频繁地注射，可能会出现更多有害的使用方式。	More harmful uses may occur as some users switch to injections or inject more frequently.	no

欧盟峰会为难民政策争论，欧盟官员：接收过程步步瓶颈-中新网	EU officials: Reception process is a bottleneck - China News Network	yes
欧盟峰会为难民政策争吵不休，欧盟官员：接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈	EU summits fight over refugee policy, EU officials: bottlenecks at every step of the admission process	yes
【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	According to AFP, at the latest EU summit on February 10, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that EU leaders had agreed to a stricter policy on illegal immigration to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.	yes
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	The move was reportedly a response to the EU's growing concern about illegal immigration, which is now at the heart of the EU's problem with the small number of illegal immigrants who can ultimately be returned.	yes
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	According to the summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to immediately mobilize large amounts of EU funds to strengthen the external borders, including infrastructure and surveillance.	yes
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	However, the EU and its member states are still in dispute over the payment of fencing fees and other issues.	yes
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	The EU funds will not cover the costs, Vanderleien has repeatedly said.	yes
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	But diplomats from some member states say that if the EU can share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along the external border, it will free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.	yes
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	European officials acknowledge that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee admission process, that limited admission capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states are unable to stop refugees from submitting a huge number of asylum applications in EU countries, and that the EU's refugee admission system is in near-permanent crisis, according to the European website Euractiv.	yes
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, almost half as many as the previous year.	yes
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.	no
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	In this context, the summit also agreed on a principle of subsidiarity, whereby EU countries can return illegal migrants to their home countries based on a judgment of a court in another member state.	no
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	In addition, EU leaders also agreed to increase the use of the concept of safe countries, which would pave the way for the EU to develop a common list, the report said.	no

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	US upgrade of silicon chips hits global semiconductor industry hard - China news	yes
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	Recently, the US war on Huawei chips has escalated significantly, with the Netherlands and Japan agreeing to start regulating the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China under pressure from the US. Foreign media reports have reported that the US government is considering cutting all ties between US suppliers and Huawei companies, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei. The Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order restricting US investment in the sensitive Chinese technology industry.	yes
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	In recent years, the United States has never stopped its efforts to combat China's silicon chip development, while cracking down on China's semiconductor supply chain, while building a semiconductor industry chain alliance to make China look like China, in an attempt to completely open up China in the advanced semiconductor industry.	yes
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it is to establish a silicon technology alliance with South Korea, or to establish a four-party alliance with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan in China, or to establish a semiconductor industry chain link by means of the US-Japanese-Indian-Australian Quadrilateral Mechanism and the Printing Sea Economic Framework, the United States is trying to build a closed production supply chain cycle led by the United States by introducing politicization, militarization, and weaponization.	yes
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	However, the US's tactical victory over China was also a blow to the enemy's self-defense.	yes
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	Recently, PanLinx, a well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier in the United States, announced that it would lay off 1,300 full-time employees and 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters, due to the latest round of export bans on Chinese chip manufacturing equipment.	yes
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	The global photogrammetry giant Asma Holding, a Dutch company, recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.	yes
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	After the US government cracked down on industries such as chips and semiconductors in China, many US companies were hit hard, including developers of electronic design automation tools, chip designers, manufacturers of crystal manufacturing equipment, and chip manufacturers themselves.	yes
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	The US is supposedly cracking down on China's advanced semiconductor industry, but instead dragging down the global semiconductor industry and supply chain.	yes
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, which has long formed a tightly linked global semiconductor industry chain.	yes
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	According to experts, the entire production process of semiconductor products based on specialized division of labor requires crossing the borders of countries more than 70 times, and the entire process takes 100 days.	no
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong base, it is weak in manufacturing capacity, especially in advanced manufacturing processes, and heavily relies on East Asia.	no
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	Even if the US is able to steer the advanced chip supply chain towards a US-led small-circle regionalisation, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor industry is difficult to change.	no
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The US is reshaping the semiconductor industry chain from China to China, creating a new global semiconductor industry.	no
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	The chip industry is the core of the future of the global industry, and the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the participation of all countries in the world.	no
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, including the introduction of the Innovation and Competition Act, the US Competition Act, the US Chip and Science Act of 2022, the use of technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership; the use of allied technology to lure chip manufacturers such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to enter the US plant, and the efforts to ensure the US's global leadership in the chip field.	no
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	In the short term, the US has indeed created problems for China's chip industry and related industries, and reaped real benefits.	no
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	But in the long run, the hysterical US pushback against China's chip industry, which has been making breakthroughs, will cost it a huge Chinese market, and ultimately weaken the innovative will and ability of US tech companies, and damage the development of the global chip industry.	no

又一大型健身房“暴雷”？	Another big gym with thunderstorms?	yes
近日，知名健身机构中健健身会员维权问题引起社会关注。	Recently, the issue of fitness members' rights in well-known fitness organizations has attracted social attention.	yes
春节后不少会员发现自己所在门店没有正常营业，随后，关于该机构倒闭跑路的传闻引起会员恐慌，导致公安、人社部门介入。	After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally, and then rumors about the closure of the runway caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of the Public Security and Human Resources departments.	yes
最后，该机构相关负责人出面回应，承诺会努力保障好员工和会员的合法权益，风波才得以平息。	Finally, the agency's relevant officials responded by promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of its employees and members, and the storm was only calmed.	yes
个别健身机构的部分门店出现经营问题，暂时关闭，消费者本可心平气和等待问题解决，为何不少会员的第一反应是“大事不妙”？	The first reaction of many members was that it was a big deal, but the reason why some of the stores in individual fitness centers had problems with operations, temporarily closed, and consumers should have been calm and wait for the problem to be solved is because they were not satisfied with the results.	yes
健身俱乐部会员维权风波背后，是行业信任危机的深层次问题。	The health club membership advocacy wave is a deep-seated crisis of confidence in the industry.	yes
国内传统健身房普遍采取预付费模式，“赚用户不来的钱”是其发展的底层逻辑。	The underlying logic behind the development of the traditional gyms in the country is the widespread adoption of pre-paid models, which eliminate the money that users cannot earn.	yes
通过预售会员卡获取现金流，不断开新店，看似能够循环往复，实则寅吃卯粮，无法形成稳定的盈利模式。	The new store, which is supposed to be a circular business, is a cash-flow-generating business, which is not a stable profit-making model.	yes
健身房跑路等行业负面信息频频传出，对消费者信心造成强烈冲击。	The negative news about the gymnastics track and other industries has been a frequent source of negative news, which has had a strong impact on consumer confidence.	yes
从市场前景看，健身房当然算得上是一门有“钱途”的好生意。	From a market perspective, gyms are certainly a lucrative business.	no

形势越是趋好，行业越需重视发展质量。	The more the situation improves, the more the industry needs to focus on quality development.	no
然而，个别机构对消费复苏后的健身市场盲目乐观，刚从危机中走出来，又吹响开疆拓土的号角，把融资资金一股脑投入新店建设上。	However, the blind optimism of some institutions about the fitness market after the consumer recovery, just emerged from the crisis, and sounded the bell of opening up the territory, putting a part of the financing capital into the construction of new stores.	no
不可否认，这几年受疫情影响，不少机构退出，行业重新洗牌，有实力的企业此时选择性地加大收购力度、重新布局，未尝不是新机遇。	It is undeniable that the pandemic has affected many institutions in recent years, with many departures, industry reshuffles, and powerful companies have now selectively increased their acquisition efforts and reorganized, which is not a new opportunity.	no
但是，健身市场发展要想进入良性循环，迈上行稳致远的康庄大道，行业就必须改变传统模式，改变经营策略。	However, if the fitness market is to enter a virtuous cycle and move forward, the industry must change its traditional model and change its operating strategy.	no
只有稳扎稳打，重新建立起消费者的信任度、安全感，才能真正赢得市场、赢得未来。	Only by fighting hard and rebuilding the trust and security of consumers can we truly win the market and win the future.	no
相比大建新店抢占市场，健身行业当前更需要的是沉下心来优化服务，用高质量发展来稳住用户。	The fitness industry needs to focus on optimizing services and developing high quality to secure users, rather than building new stores to take over the market.	no
首先，要靠服务留住用户。	First, the service is the way to retain users.	no
健身房属于服务行业，其本质是坚持“用户导向”，要紧紧围绕用户需求，把经营重心放在服务提质升级上。	The gym is a service industry, and its essence is to adhere to the user-oriented approach, to be tightly around the needs of users, and to focus on the improvement of service quality.	no
其次，要靠数字化转型提升用户体验。	Second, the user experience should be improved through digital transformation.	no
比如当下流行的互联网健身房模式，实现用户按次付费和场地自选。	The popular online gym model, for example, allows users to pay by the hour and choose their own location.	no
同时，身体数据、运动数据得以有效利用，还可以满足社交需求，实现从线上到线下完整的服务闭环。	At the same time, the use of physical and exercise data can be used effectively to meet social needs and complete the service loop from online to offline.	no
没有私教推销，没有巨额年卡，用户对健身机构“跑路”的担忧降低了，信任感也就提升了。	No private tutoring, no huge annual membership, less fear of the gyms and more confidence in the gyms.	no
另外，还要积极探索多元业态。	The project is also about exploring the possibility of a more diverse workforce.	no
如今，体育消费已经从单一服务走向场景消费，健身俱乐部有望成为消费新入口，围绕健身所需的运动补给和健身器械等周边产品或将成为新的盈利点，为消费者提供更丰富选择。	Today, sports consumption has moved from a single service to a scenario consumption, fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption, surrounding products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment needed for fitness or will be a new lever to provide consumers with more choice.	no

扬子晚报讯(记者 马祚波)扬子晚报/紫牛新闻记者10日在采访中发现，十余年未见的“保价协议”又重回了南京楼市，位于江北新区的一家楼盘宣称“差价赔付”，在交房前其他房源的优惠大于之前的折扣，开发商愿意为买房人换房并退还差价。	Yangon Evening News (Reporter Ma Zhongbo) Yangon Evening News / Zhuhai News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the price guarantee agreement for the building, which has not been seen for more than ten years, has returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A property in Jiangbei New District claims that the price difference compensates for the building, and that the developer is willing to buy the house for the owner and refund the price difference.	yes
“保价协议”条件可不少	The price guarantee agreement has many conditions.	yes
这家位于江北新区的楼盘名为保利扬子萃云台，看房人孙先生告诉记者，他在上周末逛楼盘时发现了一则“声明”。	The property in Jiangbei New District is called the Bolian Zhongyuan Tai, and the owner, Mr. Sun, told reporters that he found a brick declaration when he was looking at the property last weekend.	yes
他发给记者的图片上显示，该楼盘的开发商承诺，凡是在2月1日-2月28日期间购买房源的，自双方签订买卖合同之日起至对应房源交付，若该项目其他房源的优惠折扣大于之前购房所享折扣的(限与该商品房属于同一户型、同一楼栋、同一单元、同一物业类型的其他未售商品房)，开发商可以为购房者换房并退还差价。	The pictures he sent to reporters showed the developers of the property promising that if the preferential discount for other housing sources in the project is greater than the discount for previous purchases of housing for all housing sources purchased between February 1 and February 28, from the date of signing the purchase contract and until the delivery of the corresponding housing source, the developer can change the housing for the buyer and refund the difference in price.	yes
孙先生表示，置业顾问表示这其实就是一份“保价协议”，目的是让买家放心出手，不用担心开发企业降价促销，“现在就怕买完了它就降价了，去售楼处闹吧没时间，不闹的话也确实窝心”。	Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually a price guarantee agreement, the purpose is to make the buyer feel safe to go, without worrying about the development company's price reduction promotion, now that the price has been reduced, there is no time to go to the sales office, if not, it is really worrying.	yes
还有不少买房人则认为，“保价协议”虽然是在给购房者吃“定心丸”，不过条件却不低。	Many buyers also believe that the price guarantee agreement is a good deal, even though it gives buyers a lot of money to settle their debts, but the conditions are not bad.	yes
打算在江北买一套刚需房的郑女士说，保价的房源首先是要同一户型，还得在同一楼栋、同一个单元，买家可以比价的房源寥寥，因此“门槛”还是蛮高的。	Ms. Liu, who is planning to buy a newly needed house in Jiangbei, said that the price of the house is first of all the same type of house, on the same floor, in the same unit, and the buyer can compare the price of the house with the price of the house, so the threshold is quite high.	yes
也有购房者认为，由于信息不对称，销售时不排除给出额外的让利，买家“维权”的难度不小。	Some buyers also believe that the information is asymmetrical, and that the sale does not exclude the possibility of an additional concession, which makes it difficult for the buyer to defend his rights.	yes
能否留住买房人有待观察	The question of whether to keep the buyer is still to be seen.	no
记者在南京网上房地产上查询得知，该楼盘于去年11月首领两幢楼共计252套房源的销许，户型面积有105平方米、114平方米、129平方米等，全装修销许均价为39843元/㎡。	The building was listed on the real estate website in November last year, with a total of 252 units in two floors, with a total area of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, and a total of 39843 yuan / m2 for the average price of the fully renovated sale.	no
不过两个多月过去，网上房地产显示目前该楼盘的未售总套数为157套，占比为62.3%，其中8号楼共计128套，未售套数达113套，7号楼的124套中也有44套未售，项目的总成交套数只有33套，占比仅为13%。	However, over two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the complex is 157, accounting for 62.3%, of which 128 units are on the 8th floor, 113 units are unsold, 44 of the 124 units on the 7th floor are unsold, and the total number of completed units in the project is only 33, accounting for only 13%.	no
市场人士介绍，“保价协议”在2008年也曾在南京出现过。	The market sources said that the price guarantee agreement was also used in Nanjing in 2008.	no
当年8月份，河西黄山路上的楼盘横塘西苑为了吸引买房人眼球，推出了《保价计划》，具体内容为“公司郑重承诺，若一年内项目优惠幅度扩大，由此产生的差额，公司将按差额退还给老业主”。	In August of that year, in order to attract buyers, the company launched a price guarantee scheme, specifically promising the company that if the project's incentive margin expands within a year, the difference will be returned to the old owner.	no
此后2011年4月，南京也有9家楼盘拿出部分房源承诺“差价赔付”。	In April 2011, nine other properties in Nanjing also offered to pay compensation for the difference in price.	no
“楼市在回暖，此时更需要一针‘强心剂’。	The market is warming up, and a needle of heart-boosting medicine is needed.	no
”南京地产行业一位资深操盘手沈先生表示，“保价协议”也是房企的营销方式之一。	Shen, a senior operator in the real estate industry in Nanjing, said that the price guarantee agreement is also one of the marketing methods of the real estate company.	no
他认为如今开发企业比买房人更需要信心，推出“保价协议”其实也是在给其打气。	He believes that developers need more confidence than home buyers, and that the introduction of the price guarantee agreement is actually encouraging them.	no
至于能否留住买房人，他表示这取决于调控政策、贷款门槛等多重因素的影响，就目前来看仍有待观察。	As for whether the buyers will be able to stay, he said it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies, the loan threshold and so on, which remains to be seen.	no

新华社台北2月11日电(记者赵博、黄扬)出口贸易额“连五黑”，制造业采购经理人指数(PMI)连续7个月紧缩，消费者物价指数(CPI)又见“3字头”……近期，台湾当局陆续发布2023年1月经济数据。	Export trade volume has been on a five-month high, manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) has been down for seven consecutive months, consumer price index (CPI) has seen a rise of 3 characters...

统计显示，1月台湾地区进出口双降，出超金额仅23.4亿美元，创近3年来最低水平。	Taiwanese imports and exports doubled in January, to $2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years, according to statistics.	yes
台当局财政事务主管部门认为，全球终端需求减少，产业调整库存抑制厂商购料意愿，出口颓势短期难见改善，台湾今年首季出口衰退恐高于预期。	The Ministry of Finance believes that the decline in global terminal demand, the industry adjustment of inventory suppressed the willingness of manufacturers to buy raw materials, the export boom is unlikely to improve in the short term, and Taiwan's export recession in the first quarter of this year is higher than expected.	no

台“中央大学”经济系教授吴大任分析，出口衰退可能造成出口制造业厂商现金流出现问题，债务违约风险上升。	Professor Yang Tan, from the Department of Economics at the Central University of Taiwan, said the export slump could cause cash flow problems for export manufacturers and increase the risk of debt default.	no
同时，订单减少导致厂商削减人力成本，影响劳动市场和家庭经济，反过来冲击消费能力。	At the same time, the decrease in orders has led to manufacturers cutting labor costs, affecting the labor market and household finances, which in turn has impacted consumer spending.	no
台湾经济研究院研究员邱达生认为，今年欧美通胀状况未解，需求持续萎缩，预估台湾出口衰退会延续到上半年。	The Taiwan Institute of Economics researcher, Mr. Tan Da-chan, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States is uncertain this year, demand continues to contract, and Taiwan's export recession is expected to continue into the first half of the year.	no

报告认为，电商行业内容生态是一个综合性概念，是将电商与内容进行整合，但并非所有内容都可与电商整合，好的PGC(专业生产内容)与UGC(用户原创内容)才是与电商进行整合的优质载体，内容平台价值越高，消费与推广的场景也就越来越丰富，电商植入的可能性也就越高，商业价值也就越强，这种公共领域和私人领域逐步集成分布的电商内容生产和内容消费的比例也就会越高。	The report argues that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept, which is to integrate e-commerce with content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce, good PGC (professional production content) and UGC (user original content) is the quality of the integration with e-commerce carriers, the higher the value of the content platform, the more abundant the consumption and promotion of the scene, the greater the possibility of e-commerce implantation, the stronger the commercial value, the higher the proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption of this gradual integration of components in the public and private sectors.	no

同时，内容成为电商发展新阶段的根本和抓手，知识付费、专业性知识、KOL(关键意见领袖)等PGC内容开始在电商直播中成为标配。	At the same time, content has become the foundation and catalyst for the new stage of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, KOL (key opinion leader) has become the standard in e-commerce live broadcasting.	no
展望电商行业的未来发展，喻国明提出两方面的建议。	Looking ahead to the future of e-commerce, Guo Ming made two suggestions.	no
一个是从内容结构提升的角度看，推动电商内容生态健康程度和质量整体提升，打造正向内容创作和管理标准，实现电商行业内容生态健康系统指数与动态均衡。	One is from the perspective of improving the content structure, promoting the overall improvement of the ecological health level and quality of e-commerce content, creating positive content creation and management standards, and achieving the content ecological health system index and dynamic balance of the e-commerce industry.	no
另一个是从外部生态看，要实现内容电商行业的健康发展和外部环境的价值协同与共创。	Another is the synergy and co-creation of value in the external environment to achieve a healthy development of the content e-commerce industry from the external ecological point of view.	no
“未来电商行业还需要更多的数据、人工智能方面的支持，形成对未来发展稳定性的预测；此外，为商家提供更规范、健康的成长空间，实现电商行业中企业、用户、产品与服务的价值协同，共创健康内容生态。	The future e-commerce industry also needs more data and artificial intelligence support to form predictions for future development stability; In addition, to provide more regulated and healthy growth space for merchants, to realize the value synergy of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and to co-create a healthy content ecosystem.	no

朝鲜官媒“朝鲜中央电视台”事后释出阅兵式影片，曝光了更多父女情深的画面。	The official media released a video of the parade on North Korean Central Television, which showed more intimate scenes of the father and daughter.	yes
金正恩在主席台上数次与女儿对望，两人脸上的笑容从未退去，还互相在耳边讲悄悄话，金主爱一度以双手捧起老爸的两颊，金正恩也以灿笑回应。	Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the podium, and the smiles never left their faces, and they talked in their ears, Kim Jong-un once held his father's arms with both hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a laugh.	yes

这些迹象让外界怀疑金主爱是否已经被内定为金氏政权的继承人，《华盛顿邮报》分析认为“这是金正恩把中学年纪的女儿推上接班人地位的讯号”，不过也有观点认为，这样的判断仍为时过早，在金正恩膝下有儿子的情况中，仍保有各种可能性。	The signs have raised doubts about whether Kim Jong-il has been cast as the heir apparent to the Kim dynasty, with the Washington Post analyzing the move as a signal for Kim to put his middle-school-aged daughter in the position of successor, though there are those who argue that such a judgment is premature and that there are still possibilities in the case of Kim having a son on his knees.	no
重阳问答︱如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Chong Yang asked Qiao Qiao how he viewed the January non-farm employment data in the US, the big over-expectations and future trends - Economic Watch Network - Professional Financial News Website	yes
Q：请问重阳投资，如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势？	Q: How do you see the January non-farm employment data in the US exceeding expectations and future trends?	yes
A：2月3日美国劳工部公布2023年1月非农就业数据，新增非农就业51.7万人，大幅高于市场预期的18.9万人；失业率降至3.4%，为近50年以来的最低位；时薪同比增速4.4%，环比增速0.3%，略有放缓。	A: January 3, 2023 nonfarm employment data released by the U.S. Department of Labor, adding 517,000 nonfarm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years; hourly wage growth was 4.4%, year-over-year growth was 0.3%, slightly slower.	yes
从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	In total, there are many one-time and technical factors that have disrupted the data, such as teachers who are on strike, the revision of the survey caliber, the update of the seasonality factor, which may be corrected later (refer to the new non-agricultural increase in January 2022 from 504,000 to 364,000), and non-agricultural employment may not be as strong as the data shows.	yes
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	Structurally, the impact of high-tech firms' layoffs remains, but is low; new jobs in high-touch services such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare have recovered significantly, and data shows that the service sector's labor force gap remains.	yes
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Combined with the equally over-expected service PMI, the rebound in job vacancies and the labor gap data, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service sector is in a fast recovery after the extreme weather and the holidays.	yes
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	We believe that the supply and demand tensions in the US job market will not improve without a recession.	yes
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	The U.S. labor market is still short of more than 5 million workers, and labor participation is slowly increasing, especially among those aged 25-54 who are nearing their pre-pandemic highs.	yes
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	In addition, strong consumer demand, due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit of US residents, will further delay the impact of austerity policies on the labor market.	yes
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	The continued tension in the US labor market will be the underlying cause of the US economy in 2023.	yes
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	The overlap is now coming to an end, inflation expectations are recurring, and we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.	no
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Prior to the data, the US equity and debt markets were overly optimistic about the Fed's path to raising interest rates.	no
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	With the continuing improvement in inflation data, the Fed is slowing down the pace of rate hikes and maintaining the fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market is blind to the Fed's biased narratives, not only expecting an early end to the rate hike, but also expecting two rate cuts by the end of the year.	no
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	In a situation of tight supply and demand in the labor market and uncertain impact of austerity policy, we believe that the guidance of the US Federal Reserve for raising interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the extreme adjustment and crowding of transactions expected in the market will cause some damage to the market.	no
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	However, the persistence of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapidly declining inflation, with the M2 data year-on-year overload and the gradual improvement of the leading indicators of various CPI sub-indices, since October, the US CPI data has moved into a phase of rapid decline, the persistence of wage growth will only form the basis for future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, after the next inflation data is released, the market will enter a new round of games.	no
杉杉创始人郑永刚因突发心脏疾病过世 曾带领中国服装第一股转型 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	The founder of Suzuki, Yang Yonggang, died of a sudden heart attack after leading the first transformation of Chinese clothing - Economic Watch Network - Professional Financial News Website	yes
经济观察网 记者 郑淯心 2月11日，认证主体为杉杉控股有限公司（以下简称“杉杉控股 ” ） 的微信公众号发布讣告，杉杉企业创始人、杉杉控股董事局主席郑永刚因突发心脏疾病救治无效，于2023年2月10日去世，享年65岁。	On February 11, the certification body issued a public notice to WeChat public number of Sugiyama Holding Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Sugiyama Holding Co., Ltd.) that the founder of Sugiyama Enterprises, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sugiyama Holding Co., Ltd., Yang Yongkang, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to sudden cardiac arrest.	yes
上世纪80年代，郑永刚担任国营棉纺厂的厂长，随着调任，1989年郑永刚成为杉杉股份的前身宁波云港服装总厂的厂长。	In the 1980s, Yang was the head of the state-owned cotton mill, and in 1989 he became the head of the Ningbo Yun Port General Clothing Factory, the predecessor of the Sugyu Group.	yes
2022年12月，在第二十届中国企业领袖年会暨第二十二届中国企业未来之星年会上，郑永刚在演讲中称，在上世纪90年代的中国西服市场，杉杉品牌的市占率曾高达37 % 。	In December 2022, during the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Future Star of Chinese Enterprises, Yang Yonggang said that in the 1990s, the market share of the Sugu brand in the Chinese western clothing market was as high as 37%.	yes
1996年杉杉股份（600884.SH）上市，成为中国服装业第一家上市公司。	In 1996, Sugihisawa became the first company in the Chinese clothing industry to list its shares on the stock exchange.	yes
就在服装业务如日中天时，杉杉集团却开始转型，因为郑永刚意识到 ， “ 一旦市场放开，中国品牌自然会形成一个梯队式品牌市场，杉杉西服想一直独领风骚，长期成为国人的国服的可能性不大 ” 。	Just as the clothing business was booming, the Sugiyashi Group began to transform, because Yang Yonggang realized that once the market opened, Chinese brands would naturally form a tiered brand market, and Sugiyashi clothing wanted to be the only one to dominate the hype, and it was unlikely to become the national clothing of the country for a long time.	yes
1999年，杉杉开始研究企业转型，郑永刚回忆当年 ， “ 我们来到上海，寻求到底转型做什么，专门找了很多专家学者，连续不断地开一些诸葛亮会、务虚研讨会。	In 1999, Sugisugi started to study corporate transformation, and Yang Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai to find out what transformation really does, and we specifically sought out many expert scholars, and we held a series of discussions and workshops".	yes
最后，我们设定了两个大的战略方向。	Finally, we have set two major strategic directions:	yes
第一个方向是新能源新材料，另外一个是大健康有未来 ” 。	The first is new energy and new materials, the other is a healthy future.	yes
战略方向确定后，杉杉开始寻找合作，那时候鞍山热能院为鞍钢配套的炭素研究所在做国家863课题，科研经费不够，于是杉杉和鞍山热能院碳素研究所签署合作协议，共同推动国家863课题“中间相炭微球”项目产业化，从事负极材料的研发、生产和销售，在国内实现负极材料的商用推广。	After the strategic direction was determined, Sugiyama began to look for cooperation. At that time, the Carbon Institute of the Busan Institute of Thermal Energy was doing the national 863 project for the aluminum steel, and the scientific funding was not enough.	yes
2001年，杉杉股份实现中间相炭微球的规模化生产，开始国产化替代，取代日本成为国内中间相炭微球主要供应商。	In 2001, Sugiyama achieved the large-scale production of intermediate-phase carbon microbubbles, and began to domesticise alternatives, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate-phase carbon microbubbles in the country.	no
这是中国第一家锂离子电池负极材料生产企业，实现了锂离子电池负极材料国产化。	It is the first lithium-ion battery negative material production company in China, and has achieved the domestic production of lithium-ion battery negative material.	no
随着锂电池的应用迅速普及，杉杉股份的锂电池业务开始逐步发展，2007年锂电材料业务被写入了杉杉股份的主营业务，服装业务营收占比逐年减少，直至2013年，杉杉股份的锂电材料业务收入全面超过服装业务。	With the rapid popularity of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Sugiyama began to develop gradually. In 2007, the lithium-ion materials business was written into the main business of Sugiyama, and the revenue share of the clothing business decreased year by year, until 2013, the revenue of the lithium-ion materials business of Sugiyama was fully exceeded by the clothing business.	no
2021年2月，杉杉股份成功并购LG化学偏光片业务，进军LCD偏光片市场，并成立偏光片企业杉金光电，该领域技术含量比较高，杉杉的主要的竞争对手都是世界500强，如韩国三星、日本的住友化学、日东电工。	In February 2021, Sugimoto successfully merged with LG Chemical's polarized film business, entering the LCD polarized film market, and founded the polarized film company Sugimoto Electric, which has a high technical content in this field. Sugimoto's main competitors are the world's top 500 companies, such as Samsung of Korea, Sumitomo Chemical of Japan, and JD Electric.	no
郑永刚曾分享过投后管理的心得 ， “ 中国的民营企业收购国际上的一些高科技企业，成功概率比较低，为什么那些收购会失败？	Yang Yonggang shared his thoughts on post-investment management, saying that Chinese private companies have a low probability of success in acquiring some of the world's top high-tech companies, so why do they fail?	no
因为大家都会去考虑，我花了那么多钱，我得去派人管对吧，这是通常会做的一个行为 ” ， 然而郑永刚则不同，杉杉收购成功的那一天，郑永刚就到杉金光电当众宣布，杉杉作为杉金的大股东，决定实施一企两制，除了郑永刚担任董事长，杉杉企业的人不派到杉金，采取授权经营的方式，原有的分配制度、企业文化、各项管理等模式不变。	But it's different with Yang Yonggang, because the day that the acquisition was successful, Yang Yonggang went to Seagate and announced to the public that Seagate, as the major shareholder of Seagate, had decided to implement the one-two system, except for Yang Yonggang as chairman, the people of Seagate's enterprise were not sent to Seagate, and the authorized way of operating, the original distribution system, corporate culture, and management models were unchanged.	no
ICC鑫椤资讯发布2022年负极数据显示，杉杉负极2022年出货量突破20万吨，同比增幅100 % ， 市场份额达16 % ， 人造石墨负极材料出货量蝉联榜首。	ICC's Negative Polarity data for 2022 shows that the Negative Polarity of the Sage Seed has exceeded 200,000 tons in shipments in 2022, a 100% year-on-year increase, and a market share of 16%, ranking first in the shipment of artificial graphite negative materials.	no
在偏光片业务方面，Yano Research统计显示，公司旗下杉金光电2022年全球市场份额达到29 % ， 预计2023年市场份额将达到32 % ， 持续位列全球第一。	In the segment of the optical film business, Yano Research's statistics show that the company's Seikichi Optical Electric has a global market share of 29% in 2022 and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to be the world's number one.	no

2月9日，杉杉股份在互动平台表示，2022年底，公司石墨化有效产能约10万吨，眉山项目的石墨化产能尚在爬坡中。	On February 9, Sugihisa, a subsidiary of Sugihisa, said on its interactive platform that the company's effective graphite production capacity is about 100,000 tons by the end of 2022, and that the graphite production capacity of the Mines project is still in the ascending phase.	no
万得显示，目前郑永刚仍为杉杉股份的董事长和实际控制人。	The company's CEO, Yang Yonggang, is still the chairman and de facto controller of the company.	no
天眼查显示，郑永刚持有杉杉控股有限公司的总股权比例是40.1 % 。	The survey shows that Yang Yonggang holds 40.1% of the total shares of Sugiyama Holding Co., Ltd.	no
杉杉股份的总经理为李智华，1968年生，历任东莞市杉杉电池材料有限公司,宁波杉杉新材料科技有限公司,湖南杉杉能源科技有限公司董事长,宁波杉杉股份有限公司副总经理。	The general manager of the company is Li Zhihua, born in 1968, formerly of Dongguan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo New Materials Technology Co., Ltd., and Hunan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and vice general manager of Ningbo Battery Materials Co., Ltd.	no
杉杉股份2月10日在投资者互动平台表示，本公司高级管理人员与本公司实际控制人不存在亲属关系。	On February 10, Sugiyama's investors' interactive platform said that the company's senior management is not related to the company's actual controllers.	no

夏立言与宋涛会面谈到国共的政治基础是“九二共识”与反台独，国民党国政基金会资深顾问赵春山则在会中表示，国民党的“九二共识”是原汁原味的“九二共识”。	In an interview with Liu, Shui Li said that the political basis of the Nationalist Party is the Ninth Conciliation and anti-Taiwan independence, while Liu Chunsan, a senior advisor to the Nationalist Party Foundation, said that the Ninth Conciliation of the Nationalist Party is the original Ninth Conciliation.	yes
赵春山分析，这与前几次参与的会议感受不同。	This is different from the previous meetings I attended.	yes
近期与大陆学界视讯座谈，以及这次的座谈，没有听到涉台学者讲武统与“反分裂法”，取而代之的是恢复交流与对话。	Recent video conferences with mainland academics, and this one, did not hear Taiwanese scholars talk about the military unification and anti-secession, but instead about the resumption of exchanges and dialogue.	yes
赵春山指出，两岸兵凶战危，中国大陆盼能透过国民党转达改善关系的意向。	The Chinese mainland hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang, which is the main party in the country.	no
因为民共之间没有互信，对方仍愿做好对台湾人工作，代表不希望两岸关系搞坏。	The Chinese government has not yet decided whether to allow the Taiwanese to stay in the country, and the Chinese government has not yet decided whether to allow the Taiwanese to stay in the country.	no
据赵春山也说，王沪宁也亲自下指示向宋涛讲“他们（台湾农渔民）提的要求，你们一定要落实”，若无法通盘解决，也要采个案处理。	According to Yang Chun-shan, Wang Yi-ning personally instructed Yang to tell him about the demands of the Taiwanese farmers and fishermen, saying that you must implement the demands, and if you cannot solve them all, you must take individual cases.	no
该报道没有提及国民党人访大陆是否当面提及中国军机军舰每日扰台，台湾少数县市的农渔问题，以及中央社记者采访是否提问此类问题。	The report did not mention whether the KMT visitor to the mainland had personally mentioned the daily disturbances of Chinese warships, the issue of farming and fishing in Taiwan's minority counties, or whether the interview with the CEN reporter had asked such questions.	no

阿拉斯加上空被击落的 “物体”究竟是什么？	What exactly is the plutonium object that was dropped over Alaska?	yes
扑朔迷离，猜测纷纷	They are lost in their own vain imaginations.	yes
美国军方周五（2月10日）下午再次动用美国最先进的隐身喷气战机F-22击落了一个在美国阿拉斯加上空飞行的尚未确定身份的物体。	The US military used its most advanced stealth fighter aircraft, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska, USA, on Friday afternoon.	yes
击落的地点距离阿拉斯加海岸十英里。	The site of the crash is ten miles off the coast of Alaska.	yes
这是美军在不到一周的时间里第二次击落空中飞行物体。	This is the second time in less than a week that the US military has shot down an object in the air.	yes
上周六，来自中国的一个间谍气球在美国领空上漂移数日后在美国南卡罗莱纳州沿岸附近上空被击毁。	On Saturday, a spy balloon from China was shot down over the coast of South Carolina, USA, days after it drifted in US airspace.	yes
五角大楼说，第二个被击落的物体于周四晚上首次进入美国领空，在阿拉斯加东北部上空移动时被美国军方跟踪，飞行高度为1.2万米（4万英尺），其大小与一辆小型汽车差不多，与先前被击落的那个中国间谍气球相比要小很多。	The second object shot down, which first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska, at an altitude of 12,000 meters (~40,000 feet), the size of a small car, and much smaller than the Chinese balloon that was shot down earlier, the Pentagon said.	yes
五角大楼还认为，目前没有迹象显示，这个物体是可操纵的。	The Pentagon also believes that there is no indication that the object is manoeuvrable.	yes
白宫国家安全委员会战略沟通协调员约翰·科比周五表示，虽然这个在高空飞行的物体的具体样子尚不清楚，但它“对民航飞机的安全构成了合理的威胁”。	John Coby, the White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator, said Friday that while the exact nature of the high-flying object is unclear, it poses a legitimate threat to the safety of civil aviation aircraft.	yes
科比表示，这个物体与美国境内发现的那个间谍气球不同，它上面没有悬挂“有效载荷”。	The object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, had no hanging cargo pod, Coby said.	yes
科比说，“我们把它称为一个‘物体’是我们目前能够作出的最好的描述”。	"We call it a 'cyan object' - that's the best description we can come up with right now", says Kobe.	no
拜登总统在下令击落这个物体之前听取了五角大楼的建议，他作出这个决定的时候“非常谨慎”，科比补充说。	President Biden consulted with the Pentagon before ordering the object to be shot down, and he was very cautious in making that decision, Coby added.	no
美国官方对这个物体的描述大致可以归纳为：大小相当于一辆小汽车，没有操纵杆，没有悬挂装置，飞行高度为一万米左右。	The official US description of the object is roughly as follows: the size of a small car, no rudder, no suspension, flying at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.	no
但这些信息还无法回答基本问题，比如这个物体究竟是什么东西，它属于哪个国家，它在执行什么任务。	But the information does not answer basic questions such as what the object is, what country it belongs to, what it is doing.	no
目前网上许多的分析和猜测认为，这可能又是一只中国气球。	Many of the current online analyses and speculations suggest that it could be another Chinese balloon.	no
它可能与入侵美国领空的那只间谍气球和在拉美上空飘动的那只中国气球一样都来自中国，它们在不同地点执行某种任务。	It could be that the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that hovered over Latin America were both from China, performing some kind of mission in different places.	no
也有人把阿拉斯加的这个“物体”与“不明飞行物”（UFO）联系在一起。	The Alaska UFO is also associated with the UFO phenomenon.	no
美国新闻周刊的报道引用美国前众议员彼得·梅杰（Peter Meijer）周五在推特上发出的推文说，“真希望这个‘不明飞行物’也是一个间谍气球，而不是一个合法的UFO”。	The US Newsweek article quoted former US Representative Peter Meijer as tweeting on Friday that he hoped the UFO was a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO.	no
“将外星飞船与气象气球混为一谈的讽刺意味很令人惊讶，但这不值得引发一场星际冲突，”梅杰说。	The irony of conflating alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it is not worth the risk of an interstellar conflict, says Boommerge.	no
梅杰是在科比证实阿拉斯加的这个物体被击落之后不久发出这个推文的。	The tweet was posted by Majors shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object had been shot down in Alaska.	no
新闻周刊说，怀疑这个物体是UFO的不止是梅杰一人。	Newsweek said that more than one person suspected the object was a UFO.	no
田纳西共和党籍众议员蒂姆·伯切特（Tim Burchett）批评政府上个月的掩盖情报的做法，要求国家情报总监办公室 (DNI)公布有关“不明飞行物”的报告。	Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, criticized the government's cover-up last month, asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on missing UFOs.	no

接着客服通知要么保留货品补偿一定金额，要么退货。	The customer service will then either withhold the goods for a certain amount of compensation or return them.	yes
这就是亚马逊的处理方式？	This is how Amazon handles it?	yes
真的很难以置信，本身衣物发错并不是我的问题，作为一个消费者我要求获得我应获得的商品，并没有提出什么很夸张的要求，亚马逊却改名字，说无库存。	It's hard to believe that the clothing itself is not my problem, that I as a consumer demanded to get the goods I should have, and didn't make any exaggerated demands, and Amazon changed its name and said it had no stock.	yes
这是我的第一个长评，希望这不是我的最后一个。	This is my first long comment, and hopefully not my last.	yes
让人无法理解的袖子	The Sleeve That Made It Unintelligible	yes
说是牛皮的，也确实比较硬，但仔细看的话，局部有很多细小的裂痕，搞不清楚是否是真皮的，另外这个衣服的袖子真是让人无法理解，通常夹克的袖子要比衣摆长一些，不过通常也就1-2厘米，这件衣服足足长了5厘米，手臂自然下垂应该在手掌虎口的位置，但这件衣服的袖子都盖过手指了。	The sleeves of the jacket are longer than the shirt, but usually only 1-2 cm.

衣服做工不错，因为版型偏小，只得退货，但是退了货以后，至今一个多星期过去了，还没有收到退款？	The clothes are good, because the prints are small, and they have to be returned, but it's been more than a week since the return, and I still haven't received my refund?	yes
而且要购买者自已和那个诚信度不怎么样的全峰快递联系，这是自购亚马逊的物品以来最糟糕的一次购物！	And to have to buy from the same company that didn't have the same integrity, and that was the worst thing since buying from Amazon!	yes
但店家还是不错的，积极配合催促快递及时退款，但是这个全峰快递实在的工作是做的相当让人愤怒，拖拉半个月左右才退款，这种合作伙伴是要拖亚马逊的后腿的，工作效率差，没有服务意识！	But the store is still good, actively cooperating to promote express delivery and timely refunds, but this full-peak express delivery is actually doing a rather irritating job, delaying about half a month to refund, this partner is to drag the back legs of Amazon, poor work efficiency, no service awareness!	yes

第一次亚马逊用的合作的天天烂快递，第一次送货没在家，后来主动和快递员约了两次送货时间，那个快递员都不送，后来直接给我退货了，这个该死的快递员一点诚信也没有，强烈建议不要再用那个天天烂快递了。	The first time Amazon used the collaboration of the daily messenger, the first delivery was not at home, then the initiative and the courier agreed on two delivery times, the courier did not deliver, then directly returned the package to me, the damned courier did not have any integrity, strongly recommend not to use the daily messenger again.	yes

我申请退货，厂家的人看到图片后说是运输导致，这不是瞎说吗？	I asked for a refund, and the manufacturer said it was because of the shipping, after seeing the pictures, isn't that a big deal?	yes
商品内部怎么可能磨损？	How can the inside of a product wear out?	yes
只有两种可能，要么次品旧品，要么就是我故意损坏商品，然后拿去退货。	There are only two possibilities, either I used the product or I intentionally damaged the product and returned it.	yes
客观来讲，我没有证据证明我没有损坏商品，但是以我在亚马逊购物的信用记录来讲，我认为这样的商品不应该出现在亚马逊自营商品中，客户选择亚马逊自营就是信任，customer win，we win，客户的胜利就是厂商的胜利，希望大家一起努力改进，谢谢。	Objectively speaking, I have no evidence that I have not damaged the goods, but based on my credit history of Amazon purchases, I think that such goods should not appear in Amazon self-made goods, customers choose Amazon self-made is trust, customer win, we win, customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory, hope that we all work together to improve, thank you.	yes
我使用该产品不到一年，就出现两个E2，我不知道如何处理?	I've been using this product for less than a year and I've got two E2s, I don't know how to handle them?	yes
我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?	I bought the product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the red E2 was often seen in the two sets on the right side of the receiver, should be a problem with the launch module, which is not compatible with the launch module's 7 years of sustainable work on the Amazon website, and after not being able to find it on the Amazon website, now I don't know how good it is?	yes

不足就是没有卡，自己买的，还有就是以前在亚马逊买过手机。	It's not enough to have no card, buy it yourself, or buy a phone from Amazon before.	yes
包装上会有贴纸，防止包装被打开，这次没有，买手机时候还有个贴纸一样的章，可以贴在保修卡上，这次没有。	The packaging has a sticker to prevent the package from being opened, but this time there is no sticker, and when you buy a mobile phone, there is a sticker that can be attached to the warranty card, but this time there is no such thing.	yes

等待供货商回复	Waiting for a response from the supplier	yes
包装没有任何标识，直接给供货商致电说，回答没标识是正品，如怀疑可用边角料邮寄到强生公司验货，还留下车牌号以及电话号码，承诺会发短信通知把我的信息输入强生官网保修卡，到现在也没收到短信啊？	The packaging is not marked, I called the supplier directly and said that the unmarked package is genuine, I was wondering if I could send the product to J&J by mail, I left the license plate number and phone number, I promised to send a text message to inform me that I had entered my information into the J&J warranty card, and I haven't received a text message yet?	yes

订单编号：503-4265464-1830254。	The order number is 503-4265464-1830254.	yes
我当初购买的页面尺码选项为7c，8，9c，当时觉得这就是个陷阱，打电话给日亚中文客服，明确告知8就是8c，但是等商品回到中国才发现，只有8cm，我觉得这完全是故意设下的陷阱来坑中国人（按照亚马逊的售后），现在查看页面已没有这个选项。	I bought the page size options 7c, 8, 9c, I thought it was a trap, I called the customer service in China and told them 8c was 8c, but when I returned to China I found that it was only 8cm, I thought it was a trap set to trap the Chinese people (according to Amazon), now I look at the page and there is no such option.	yes
中方客服：很抱歉，给你带来损失了，我们给你两条路走：	Chinese customer service: Sorry for the loss, we have two options for you:	yes
1，你退货，买家承担所有运费。	1, You return the item, the buyer bears all the shipping costs.	yes
2，你不退货，我们补偿你1000日元。	2, if you don't return the item, we will refund you 1,000 yen.	yes
（我算一下账，鞋子4000多日元，算作200rmb，选择1，我没有鞋子，损失在200元。	(I counted, the shoes cost over 4000 yen, counted as 200 rmb, choose 1, I don't have shoes, the loss is 200 yuan ▽)	yes
选择2，我有鞋子，最后补偿了我2000日元，最后损失在150rmb 客服：我们已记录下来，我们会认真处理，次日回了封邮件，说我不接受中方客服调解，就这么完了。	Option 2, I have shoes, I was compensated with 2000 yen, I lost 150 rmb. Customers: We have recorded it, we will deal with it seriously, the next day I got back an email saying that I do not accept Chinese customer mediation, and that's it.	yes
我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	I suggested that the page to buy was 7c, 8, 9c, and that was a confusing option, but the Chinese customer service told me that the Japanese code would not be a c, like 140, but did you go to other pages about caterpillars?	yes
都有美码，日码混标的情况出现。	The Japanese language is also used in the country, but it is not the same as the Japanese language.	no
再说，你8cm为什么放在7c和9c中间，明明最小的尺码，你放那里算什么意思。	And why did you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, the smallest size, and what did you mean by that?	no
中方客服：我们提供中文服务，但是不知道你要运回国，所以你的运费我们是不予理赔的。	Chinese Service: We provide Chinese language service, but we don't know that you are going to be sent back to China, so we won't be responsible for your shipping costs.	no
这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	I don't understand this logic anymore, I'm Japanese, I also want Chinese suits, Chinese people living in Japan don't need Chinese suits, go to Japan as a tourist, without that kung fu to make long international trips, then the question arises, who needs to call Amazon overseas to buy Chinese phones, just like me who is a day-to-day scout.	no
亚马逊中文客服不就是方便了我们海淘的这些人吗？	Amazon's Chinese customer service is not helping those people who are taking our products to the market?	no
这次购买不是很满意	This purchase was not satisfactory.	yes
这是第二次从亚马逊上购买帮宝适尿布，曾经在宝宝2个月的时候买过一箱，选择了欧洲进口纸张的尿布，第一次购买经历还是比较满意的，宝宝整夜就用一张尿布，的确可以满足12个小时不换尿布。	This is the second time I have bought a diaper from Amazon, I bought a box when my baby was 2 months old, I chose a diaper made of European imported paper, and I was satisfied with my first purchase, my baby used a diaper all night, and it was really enough to last 12 hours without changing diapers.	yes
但是这次购买L号的尿布，一箱里面有2包分开包装，打开后就觉得纸张比较松，跟进口帮宝适有明显区别，给宝宝用了之后，还算可以，没有漏尿也没有红疹等迹象。	But this time I bought L diapers, there are 2 separate packages in one box, and when I opened it, I felt the paper was loose, and the difference was obvious, after I gave it to the baby, it was fine, there was no leakage of urine and no signs of rash.	yes
但是到了第二包尿布，开始使用后宝宝的大腿内侧立马就出现了红疹，至今还没有褪去。	But when the second pack of diapers was used, the baby's belly button immediately turned red and has not yet been removed.	yes
怀疑1箱里面的2包，质量还不一样啊。	I'm not sure if the quality of the two packs in one box is the same.	yes
以后应该不会继续购买了！	I'm not going to buy any more!	yes

比我想象的小一些，不过本来就是拿来带出门用的，所以还可以接受。	It's a little smaller than I thought, but it's meant to be used for carrying out, so it's acceptable.	yes
昨晚拿回家试了一下，瓶盖推开之后，吸管和盖子之间的距离太近了，因为吸管的位置是正向垂直的，所以儿子总是要把盖子上面的凸起含住喝水，觉得这个地方是否可以改进一下。	I tried it last night when I got home, but after the lid was pushed back, the distance between the straw and the lid was too close, because the position of the straw was perpendicular, so the son always had to raise the lid above the container to drink water, to see if the place could be improved.	yes
看来其他牌子的吸管杯把吸管做的倾斜还是有道理的，小孩子的东西，真的就是在乎安全和舒适。	It seems that the other brands of straw cups have a reasonable slant on the straw, something that little kids really care about, safety and comfort.	yes
轻便大容量	Lightweight and large	yes
喜欢它轻便，开口大，就是两个独立的分隔袋对我来说有点多余，感觉不知道装什么好。	I like it light, open, and two separate compartments are a bit redundant for me, I feel like I don't know what to put in.	yes

因为信任，所以伤心，毕竟是抹脸的用品，真的去实体店买吧，认可贵一点。	I'm not sure if I'm going to buy it, but I'm going to buy it because I trust it, so it's sad, after all, it's a face mask, so go to the physical store and buy it, it's a little expensive.	yes

假货？	What is the truth?	yes
总之悲剧。	The tragedy of it all.	yes
用第二片的时候选的毛孔细致的，但是一打开就一股怪味，以为是正常的，因为没用过这款，然后往脸上贴的时候就整个受不了了，非常冲的味道，无法形容，熏到立马咳嗽了出来，眼睛也很痛，流眼泪，马上摘了去洗脸。	The hair was selected with the second piece carefully, but when it was opened, it had a strange smell, thought it was normal, because it had not been used, and then when it was applied to the face, it was completely unbearable, a very pungent smell, indescribable, the smell came out immediately, the eyes were very painful, tears came out, and immediately took it off to wash the face.	yes

奸商啊	You are a traitor.	yes
当时购买的时候，活动页面上是说满99元赠送“三体全集”，收到货没有这个赠品，打客服电话说要给他们看当时活动的截图，问题是谁买东西还把网页截图保存啊，你们自己做过的活动，还需要顾客帮你们提供啊，各位买家下次要留个心眼，保存证据。	When I bought it, the campaign page said that I would give a full set of three sets of 99 yuan, but when I received the goods, there was no such gift, so I called the customer and asked to show them the screenshot of the campaign, the question was who bought the goods and saved the screenshot of the website.	yes
用后感受	The aftermath	yes
第一次在亚马逊买东西，分别感受有几点，先来说下用完商品的感受吧，第一确实是无痛，也没有刺激味道的东西，总体来说很不错的，静等8分钟左右一擦就掉了，只是会有少量的汗毛渣在上面，不细看是看不出来的，所以说总体是不错的，至于之后都就用一次还要继续观察，继续用才会知道。	The first time you buy something on Amazon, you feel a few things, first of all, the feeling of using the product, the first is really painless, and there is no stimulating taste, in general it is very good, wait for about 8 minutes and a wipe will fall off, only a small amount of sweat and hair on it, you can't see it, so it is generally good, so after using it again and again to continue to observe, continue to use it to know.	yes

第三，亚马逊的什么黑色星期五就不要相信了，星期五下单，等了2天就便宜了接近12块钱，也就是我买成170多（加上运费什么的），有一种搞活动就提价格的感觉样。	Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday, ordered on Friday, and after waiting 2 days, it's almost $12 cheaper, which means I bought 170 more (plus shipping costs), and there's a feeling of raising the price by doing something.	yes
客服说什么价格波动，我关注了10多天价格也就是这个样，波动也不大的。	I've been following the price fluctuations for more than 10 days, and that's what it is, not much fluctuation.	yes
价格实惠，日原产，有中文标签，带颗粒，绝对回购！	Affordable, Japanese-made, with Chinese labels, with pellets, definitely a buyback!	yes
膏体里带颗粒的，清爽感恰到好处，用后牙齿爽滑，上比某二手东强太多啦，那里说是进口的东西，可好多东西没有中文标签，不知从哪里批发的。	The cream is fine with particles, it feels fresh, it's smooth with the back teeth, it's much stronger than some second-hand Oriental, where they say it's imported, but many things don't have Chinese labels, they don't know where they are from.	yes
以后只要亚马逊有的，绝不再去二手东。	The company has also announced that it will no longer sell second-hand goods on Amazon.	yes
给个建议，亚马逊的app 上晒单怎么有时晒不了，希望能改进一些应用，会做的越来越好的！	I'm going to give you a suggestion, Amazon's app is not always able to fill out the list, hopefully it will improve some of the apps, and it will do better and better!	yes

图片质量实在不能接受	The quality of the images is unacceptable.	yes
作为“古地图集”这样的标题，本书在图片的选择、排版、印刷上实在令人难以接受，有些图片甚至有马赛克，模糊到无法辨识。	As a title for a collection of ancient maps, the book is difficult to accept in terms of the selection, typography and printing of the images, some of which even have mosaics that are too blurred to be recognized.	yes
即便本书不是专业的地图册，即便是小画幅插图，也应该对得起目录中祖先留下来的洋洋大观的中古文献资料！	Even if this book is not a professional map, even if it is a small illustration, it should be able to compare the vast amount of medieval documents left by our ancestors in the catalog!	yes
（况且很多图片是可以从相关行业资源中获取清晰的原始文件的），用这样的图片来拼凑图书与不使用图片有何差别？	(And many of the images are clear, original files from relevant industry resources), what's the difference between using such images to compose a book and not using them?	yes

文字方面不予评价，方家各有分辨。	The text is not evaluated, but each family has its own opinion.	yes
整体2星。	Overall 2 stars	yes

然后...就掉坑里了。	Then... it fell into the pit.	yes
按着这个剧情来说，整本书都是比较轻松愉快的，前部分叶修还在网游里的时候，即使是公会之间勾心斗角，也因为往往被叶神狗血，搞得一点也不沉重。	The first part of the book is a bit light and fun, even if the plot is between the two communities, because it is often bloody by the blood of the gods.	yes
至于到了比赛的部分，写出了时代的变迁新旧交替的一点点心酸之感（可能是我多愁善感）。	As for the competition, I'm a little bit bitter about the change of times and the alternation of old and new (maybe it's my sentiment).	yes
看整部书花了我高二许多学习时间，可是就是停不下来。	I've spent a lot of time studying the whole book, but I can't stop.	yes
全职对人物和感情线的描写让人十分惊艳，有的人物只是偶尔带过，也会给人留下很深的影响，像比较重点描写的角色叶修黄少天苏沐橙都有大量的粉丝，而不在写作中心的角色例如江波涛楚云秀等等也十分找人喜欢，在一个电竞的爽文中竟然让人找不到一个让人讨厌至极的人物，这是全职在人物描写上的成功。	Full-time portrayal of characters and emotional lines is very surprising, some characters are only occasionally brought, but also leave a deep impact on people, like the character portrayed more emphasis Ye Xiao Huang Chao Tian Suo has a large number of fans, while not in the writing center characters such as Jiang Bo Bo Zhu Yunhui and others are very popular, in a competitive essay of electricity, it is not possible to find a person who is extremely disgusting, this is a success in full-time character portrayal.	yes
而在感情线上，全职也没有一般网文所令人诟病的后宫佳丽三千万要么美女要么腐的毛病，全文所有人的感情，都有一个共同的地方就是他们喜欢着荣耀这个游戏，并且大都想要堂堂正正的胜利。	And on the emotional front, there is no full-time post-mortem, which is sickening for the general netizens, and there are no beauty or rotten problems, all the people's feelings have one thing in common: they love to glorify the game, and most of them want to win honestly.	yes
小计量有却没有什么大阴谋，每个人看上去都那么单纯可爱。	The small measures, but no big plot, everyone looks so simple and lovely.	yes
这或许也是为什么全职没有什么令人讨厌的角色。	This is probably why there are no full-time annoying roles.	yes
全职的IP很大，也归功于此。	The full-time IP is large, thanks to this.	yes
撇开网文这个文化现象不谈，全职不失为一本不错的书。	The book is a cultural phenomenon, and a good book, regardless of the web version.	no
多少他真的会给人提供一些热血，一点点感动。	How much he really gives to people, a little bit of warmth, a little bit of emotion.	no
今年4月份全职要动漫化。	The anime is scheduled to be released in April this year.	no
其实想要买齐这套书很久了，碍于永远钱包不够厚都没狠下心下手，然后想要买的时候就发现，tb上简直是假货猖獗，其实全职最近出了另一个版本，封面图吧我自己是蛮喜欢的，但还是打算先买老的版本，所以就在亚马逊上看了看，一次性买下来了一套。	I've been wanting to buy this book for a long time, but my wallet is not big enough to keep me from doing it, and then I wanted to buy it, but it was a fake, and in fact, another version was released recently, and I liked the cover art, but I was going to buy the old version first, so I looked it up on Amazon, and bought a set.	no
接下来简单说一下货的情况。	The next step is to simply talk about the situation of the goods.	no
●第四本的塑封没有，但书是新的。	● The fourth book has no plastic cover, but the book is new.	no
●第十七本塑封是在但是被打开了，书的质感也很奇怪感觉没有其他的硬。	The 17th plastic book was opened, and the texture of the book was strange, as there was no other hardness.	no
●第23本和第十七本情况一样，但是也比第十七本硬，但十分的旧。	The same situation as in the case of the 23rd and the 17th, but also harder than the 17th, but much older.	no
●个别几本书的出版社不同好像第23和17就是同一个出版社，和其他的不同。	● The publishers of the individual books are different, as if the 23rd and 17th were the same publisher, and different from the others.	no
●整体来讲还算满意，24本很大一箱，很满足。	● Overall, I'm satisfied with the 24 boxes, which is a big one.	no
落寞的小狮子	The young lion with the hood	yes
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as a lost antler, but it turned out to be a lot of words!	yes
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	The book was read three times before it was finished to the children, a little lion who can shoot, a little lion who loves to eat juice and sugar.	yes
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	The lion eating the hunter is a bit uncomfortable to watch, and modern urban people are a bit unacceptable to the arrangement of being eaten by animals.	yes
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	Finally, the little lion who succeeded in human society, lost himself, he was no longer a full lion, nor a full man.	yes
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	Finally, only the back of the lioness, who doesn't know where he went.	yes
可能多年以后，这个小狮子的形象还留在长大了的小朋友的印象中，在某一天不经意的时候被想起，或许对她会有触动或是启发。	Perhaps years later, the image of the lion will be remembered by the children who have grown up, and perhaps one day, when they are not thinking, they will be touched or inspired.	yes
性价比很高的作品集	The collection of works with high sex ratio	yes
1、以前还不知道TASCHEN，最近买了不少他们的书，原因就是太强悍，不论是选题还是制作本身。	I didn't know about Taschen before, but I've bought a lot of their books lately because they're so strong, both in terms of the themes and the production itself.	yes
本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	The largest edition, like the Michelangelo, is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this edition is the smallest, and comes in a two-volume edition with a bookcase.	yes
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	The first is that it is cheap, and is divided into two volumes of over 700 pages, which are also better to read as a single volume; the second is that unlike the Michelangelo collection, which is mainly painted, the Da Vinci's black and white manuscript is the largest part of the book, and for readers with limited budgets and non-art professionals, this edition is the highest price-to-value ratio for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.	yes
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	2/ The explanation of the painting part is great, there is a compositional analysis, sketch analysis and historical background (e.g. The Last Supper), but I don't know if it's a print or book size issue, some shadows are too deep in some parts of the county, I can't see the details, it's a bit of a pity.	yes
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	The manuscript of the Da Vinci Code is much more rich than that of Michelangelo.	yes
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius, the latter is so far advanced and accomplished that it is not even possible to describe his genius.	yes
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	If you only see half of Da Vinci by looking at the paintings, you will see no language at all by reading the manuscript.	yes
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Trash, who bought who regrets!	yes
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	I'm not going to give a bad review, this honest trash, bought a waste of money and a horse, give a reason!	yes

总体满意	Overall satisfaction	yes
之前一开始还担心相机的包装，这次还好，里面有充气包，相机三码一致，也能在官网注册，快门次数0，其余的就只能等时间检验了 。	I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was good, it had a bag with air, the camera was three-digit identical, it could also be registered on the official website, the shutter speed was 0, the rest can only be checked by time.	yes
发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	The delivery was very fast, the delivery boy was here, the precious items were put in the doorway, and I could not open the box in front of him to check it, I have no words for this.	yes
商家发货前做到了为客户着想:)	The merchants have been thinking about the customer before shipping:)	yes
商家比较负责，专门打电话问所用相机的屏幕尺寸，确实替客户着想了。	The businessman was responsible enough to call and ask about the screen size of the camera, and he did think about it for the customer.	yes
发货速度也快。	The delivery is fast.	yes

目前找不到亚马逊官方反馈渠道，所以只能在商品评价里反馈	Amazon's official feedback channel is not available, so only product reviews are available.	yes
1. 在 3 月 29 号，通过预购途径使用 31 元购买了此书，显示 3 月 31 号会推送到设备上，此时亚马逊官网上还无法预览该书（因为还未发布）；	1. purchased the book on March 29th for 31 yuan through the pre-order, showing that it will be shipped on March 31st, and cannot be pre-ordered on Amazon at this time (because it is not yet available);	yes
2. 3 月 31 号推送到设备上的书，内容是空白，只有敬请期待，而亚马逊上该书电子版降价到了 18 元；	2. The book, which was released on March 31st, is blank, but you can expect to see it, and Amazon has reduced the price of the e-book to 18 yuan.	yes
3. 这两天反复尝试将设备上的下载的空白的书进行删除，再次同步，都无法获取到包含实际内容的电子版《商业的本质》，但是看到亚马逊官网已经可以预览该书。	3. The two days of repeated attempts to delete and synchronize the blank book downloaded on the device, again, did not allow access to the electronic version of the commercial with the actual content, but the Amazon website has already made the book available for preview.	yes
目前我有几点感想	I have a few thoughts.	yes
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	The price is not the most important issue, the key is how to replace the blank books on the Kindle with books with real content, instead of downloading them forever.	yes
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	2. books that are pre-purchased should not be bought again, as the procedure for downloading a blank book after a ticket is sold is very complicated;	yes
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	3. Amazon should provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues, and a place to post feedback when e-books are downloaded or used in questionable ways (e.g. job listings, online customer service, see how the official Microsoft store does it)	yes
不是很推荐阅读	Not recommended reading	yes
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see it by memory.	yes
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	The book is more a collection of fragments of life's love stories than a collection of short stories.	yes
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The tone of the book is very plain, as plain as white water, the vocabulary is pursued to the extreme of brevity, and the plot is as quiet as the main street on a summer afternoon.	yes
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Each short story is a snapshot of a small moment in ordinary life, without beginning or end.	yes
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	Finally, gathered together, the crown jewels of what we are talking about when we talk about love.	yes
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I think that this collection of novels, and its title, is like an action art, the author wants to express that love is more than the sad separation on the stage, the sea of urban legend is dry, not just you and me are like paint, love is more than this and should not be represented above, love is also life as plain as water, dull and tasteless day by day, there is also the lack of life, the escape from reality, the lack of future.	yes
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	As you read this book, you may think of the couple arguing next to you, the boring marriage of the people you know, and the unpleasant feelings.	yes
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	This is why I don't recommend reading it, because the writing and plot are aesthetically dull, and unless your life is as exciting or as sweet as living in a candy castle, you'll find it strange and boring.	yes
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	In terms of depth of thought, the daily episodes do not illuminate or expand one's thoughts and perspectives (unlike Marx's love story during the Cholera epidemic), nor do the short episodes explore any questions, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love.	yes
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	The main character's marriage broke down because of those reasons?	no
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much difference if you read it or not.	no
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and style than the plot, which is also the reason why the book is a poor reading experience.	no
适合粗读,不能细看。	The book is suitable for reading roughly, but not looking at it carefully.	yes
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	The book is logical, but not rich enough.	yes
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	The article explains a lot of theories about what sales are and why, but it is weak in terms of how to do it, it only points out the direction but does not give concrete practices.	yes
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	The book also feels like a puzzle.	yes
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	The examples are both domestic and foreign; both well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and well-known people.	yes
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	I don't know if this is a story for example, but it would be more convincing if some of the stories were based on the author's own experiences.	yes
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	The name of the client varies.	yes

快速了解互联网金融的导读书	A quick guide to understanding Internet finance	yes
这本书很浅，可以说只是一个入门课，可以帮助大家快速了解互联网金融的全貌，但要深入了解，还是要按图索骥，自己去深挖。	This book is very shallow, and is an introductory course to help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but you can dig deeper, or you can dig deeper yourself.	yes
且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	The book was written earlier, but later on, we did not mention that Alipay borrowed subsidies from Weibo to train users' habits in the Great War, and today the third-party payment share is only a small percentage of what is said in the book.	yes

我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	I think it's not so much that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use them to express appreciation and gratitude to those around you, whether it's family, friends or colleagues, from your heart at any time and place.	yes

疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	Amazon to strictly review suspected counterfeit goods	yes
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	Super poor quality, loose packaging, no percentage, even worse than the products on the roadside, no weight, no bar code, ten bags of packaging is also loose, is not a qualified product characteristic; is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, has applied for a refund; is entirely a quality issue; advised merchants to wipe their eyes, rejecting substandard goods; added: bought a heart seal, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 volumes, plus several contrasting photos, further verify the product's inferiority, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, avoid economic loss and further displeasure!	yes

搞活动时候买的，很便宜，所以也不好意思给差评了，四星吧，不过不会再买了。	I bought it at the event, it was cheap, so I'm not ashamed to give it a bad rating, four stars, but I won't buy it again.	yes

黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	The black five time of the order, the result is waiting for a long time has not been received, the next enquiry, the package has been cleared, asked the colleagues around all said there was no help in the acceptance, hurry to contact the courier company, but said that the sender can initiate an enquiry, contacted Amazon customer service, and waited more than ten days, finally figured out that the courier was mistakenly delivered to someone else, and several weeks to turn around before finally get back the courier, the outer packaging has been dismantled goods, is still intact, and do not know if it has been used, it's a bad feeling.	yes
错误的配图	The wrong map	yes

操作系统一般般	Operating system in general	yes
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	For a while, the overall picture was fine, but I didn't feel any difference, the system was a bit slow to start, and the software was not very good to set up, and the response speed was more general, and compared to my colleagues, it was not a quantity.	yes
看评论说很人性化的设计，我没有找到哪里人性化，遥控器这个常用的上下左右，返回键设计的位置实在是不敢恭维。	I've seen comments about the humanized design, but I can't find any humanized ones, and the remote control is a commonly used up and down position, and the return key design is really not complimentary.	yes

在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	Amazon has accumulated a lot of unrated orders, so I've put together a sentence from the copy as a review.	yes
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I use this phrase to evaluate this product, it means that it has at least 85 points.	yes

低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	The low-cost phone is good, and it's enough to keep you warm!	yes
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	The cheapest cable, but it should be HDMI certified, in comparison to the cheapest cable in China (the price is twice as expensive), the cable is thick and soft, and the 7 meter transmission is noiseless, so the low price line is better!	yes

到货后送货员给我打电话，我说我不要了，想取消订单的没取消成功，派送员就拿回去了，说先给我签收上，让我申请退货。	When the delivery arrived, the delivery person called me and I said I didn't want it anymore, I wanted to cancel the order but it didn't work out, so the delivery person took it back and said to give me the receipt first and let me apply for a refund.	yes

我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I have bought items in both JD and Suning that are not returned, including milk, diapers, etc. and the customer service was returned, and the customer service in JD was returned after the opening of the diaper, which was too big, and you can't get it on Amazon.	yes
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	The law is dead, the man is alive, how do you deal with your clients?	yes
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	Tell me that I can either take it myself or have the courier buy it for me, it's not easy for the courier to take it for everyone, why should I let people save money to buy something that I don't buy?	yes

劝大家不要白花钱	The first is to avoid wasteful spending.	yes
首先满怀期待购买，觉得都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧，收到了以后看包装觉得还可以，个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感，吃到嘴里完全没有味道，寡淡无味，咬开来果肉一圈是暗黄色就是坏了那种，好坏参着卖的，能吃的也就不到三分之一，劝大家不要买，也不便宜，质量太差了！	First, I was looking forward to buying it, I thought that the Doral brand should not be bad, but when I received it, I thought the packaging was fine, the head was good, but there was a box that was basically soft and soft, the appearance was not visible, if you touch it, it had no taste at all, it had no taste, it was a dark yellow color, it was bad, it was sold badly, it could not eat less than a third of it, I advise you not to buy it, it is not cheap, its quality is too bad!	yes
吃一堑长一智，以后再也不在电商买水果了！	Eat a lot and never buy fruit from e-commerce again!	yes
产品防伪标识在哪里	Where is the anti-counterfeiting logo?	yes
瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的，从外包装袋看，感觉蹂躏的程度让人揪心，毕竟是食物类的包装太简单了，而且还是属于国际购的，还有没看到什么明显的防伪标识标志，开瓶非常轻松，关键是盖内的一层蜂蜜直接从里面冒出来了，有开口几乎是没有什么粘连性，外国产品都是这样的吗？	The bottle is so deeply embedded in the bottom, it should have been caused by a strong impact, from the outside of the packaging bag, the degree of friction is disturbing, after all, the packaging of food is too simple, and still belongs to international purchase, and there is no obvious anti-counterfeiting logo, the opening of the bottle is very easy, the key is that a layer of honey in the lid directly emerges from the inside, with an opening that is almost non-sticky, is this the case with foreign products?	yes

提货服务有待改进	The delivery service needs to be improved	yes
我一共买了5份提货券，在提取时，第一次预约提取3份，结果只寄过来2份，经过多方沟通才确认是漏发、答应后需补发；第二次预约，刚好赶上休息日，网站和微信均无提示需要在工作日预约，造成了不必要的恐慌，建议以后改善。	I bought 5 delivery tickets in total, when I took them out, I made the first appointment to take 3 tickets, but only 2 were sent, after many contacts, it was confirmed that they were missing, and I promised to send them again; the second appointment, just in time for the holiday, the website and WeChat did not have any information about the need to make an appointment on weekdays, which caused unnecessary panic, and suggested improvements later.	yes
不错的购物	Good shopping	yes
东西好评！	The food is good!	yes
还是比较相信亚马逊自营的东西，现在海外购以后很方便，从国外买回来物流时间比国内也就多几天，不得不说亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的，比走转运要快很多，所以现在很多东西都在海外购上买。	It is also more convenient to buy things from overseas, and the logistics time to buy from abroad is a few days longer than in the country, but I have to say that Amazon's overseas purchases to the domestic clearance capacity is still very strong, much faster than the transportation, so now many things are purchased overseas.	yes
希望国内商品的质量和价格能够更好一些，很多东西都是国内产的，但是出去转一圈买回来比在国内还便宜，希望改进。	I hope the quality and price of the domestic products will be better, many things are domestically produced, but going out and buying them is cheaper than in the country, I hope for improvement.	yes

我看这样的包装是装垃圾一样的，购买这个产品，包装及其简陋，没有任何防止破损的措施，就一个简单的塑料袋包装，到手后，包裹完全变形了，里面的物品也有破损。	I see this packaging as a waste, buying this product, its packaging and its simplicity, without any measures to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag, when it comes to hand, the package is completely deformed, the items inside are also damaged.	yes
如果我只是碰到一个这样的，我认了，买了几个都是这样子，找亚马逊客服，客服就说可以退，但运费垫付，然后运费以礼品卡的形式返回给我。	If I just happen to see one of these, I admit, and buy a few of these, I go to Amazon and they say it's a return, but the shipping is paid for, and the shipping is returned to me in the form of a gift card.	yes
我试问一下，我用现金支付运费，你们给我返礼品卡，这是要我自己买你们礼品卡就直说啊，还要自己把产品邮寄到德国仓库，这不是买个产品受罪啊!	I'll tell you what, I pay for the shipping in cash, you give me the gift card back, so I'll have to buy your gift card myself, or send the product to the German warehouse myself, it's not a crime to buy a product!	yes
而我一直跟客服说，出现这样的问题是谁的责任，客服却半句不说是他们的责任，连半句责任都不敢担当，这样的售后服务还有什么保障呢? 一句话:认栽!但我估计我这个评价，亚马逊都不会给公布的机会，直接回删除!	I've been telling customers who is responsible for this problem, but they don't say half the words that it's their responsibility, they don't even dare to say half the words that it's their responsibility, what is the guarantee of this after-sales service?	yes

4，如果亚马逊没有标注预计到货时间是2月7号，我或许会很满意。	4, I would be happy if Amazon didn't have a February 7th estimated delivery date.	yes
5，但标注了预期到货时间，就相当于给用户一个承诺，当承诺无法兑现的时候，用户很难受。	5, but the expected delivery time is equivalent to giving the user a promise, when the promise can not be met, the user is very difficult.	yes
6，如果你没有给予承诺的把握，请不要做出承诺。	6, if you are not sure of the promise, do not make the promise.	yes

金线会掉色	The yellow line will fade.	yes
效果还是有的，但感觉是否明显，就看个人咯，或是心理作用。	The effect is there, but whether it is felt is a matter of personal preference, or psychological effect.	yes
有一点不太好的，就是金色的线，本来设计出来是觉得好看，但实际上，这个金线会掉色，往车上一放，如果拿动几次，手上，和车上，会有一些金粉。	The one thing that's not so good is the gold thread, which is designed to look good, but in reality, the gold thread will fade and go to the car, and if you move it a few times, on your hand, and on the car, there will be some gold powder.	yes
希望产品可以改进。	Hopefully the product will improve.	yes
这种方形的，也没啥装饰效果，就不要搞金线上去，掉下来在车上弄脏车还麻烦。	This is a square, and without any decorative effect, don't mess with the gold line, fall down and get dirty in the car.	yes
东西完好，速度可以，分2个包裹还不同包装	Everything is fine, we can go fast, but the packaging is different.	yes
8天的速度蛮快的，但就是2件分了2个包裹，包装还不一样，明显一个防震太多了，厚纸板贴着，封了层塑料，外包装也方便拆，一个就国内的快递盒似的，放了几个缓冲气囊就算事了，感觉有点敷衍。	8 days is quite fast, but 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, the packaging is not the same, obviously one is too much, thick cardboard is attached, sealed with plastic, the outer packaging is also easy to remove, one is similar to the domestic courier box, put a few buffer gas bags even if it is, feel a little overlapping.	yes

并不是自营商品，亚马逊无耻了	Amazon is not a self-made product, it's shameless	yes
页面明确标注自营，实际上由供应商配送，售后由供应商负责，出问题自行联系供货商。	The page clearly states that the product is self-supplied, but is actually delivered by the supplier. After the sale, the supplier is responsible for the product. If you have any questions, contact the supplier yourself.	yes
想取消订单，对不起，订单信息已传递给供应商，不能取消；想退换货，在亚马逊成功申请了退换货，对不起，没有人理你，需要自行联系供货商退货。	To cancel an order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, can not be canceled; to exchange goods, successfully applied for a return on Amazon, sorry, no one cares about you, you need to contact the supplier yourself to return.	yes
这尼玛哪门子自营商品。	This is a self-made product.	yes

之前在别家网购的滤芯，过滤效果不错，28天结束之后再用多一两天也一样没有水垢。	The filter was good, and after 28 days, it was still free of scale after another day or two.	yes
由于一直以来在亚马逊购置的东西品质都可以，这次就想着在这边买，第一次在亚马逊买滤芯，感觉不太好，不但早早就开始有水垢，而且滤芯一直用到第28天，都会有悬浮的小黑碳粉，真不知道是继续用下去，还是直接扔了好，非常郁闷~	Since I have always been able to buy quality products from Amazon, this time I wanted to buy here, I bought the filter core for the first time on Amazon, it didn't feel good, not only did it start to have scale early on, but the filter core was used until the 28th day, there was a small black carbon powder floating, I didn't know whether to continue using it, or just throw it away.	yes
没有想象的那么好	It's not as good as I thought it would be.	yes
和我以往用过的插线板比较，外部做工一般，内部如何未拆开看，但愿如店家所描述，从使用方便性上看，每一独立单位是否通电缺少显示	Compared to the plugboard I have used before, the exterior works as usual, the interior is not disassembled, but as described by the shop owner, from the ease of use, each separate unit is not equipped with a power supply	yes
包装破损了，等时间来检验产品的质量。	The packaging is damaged, so it is time to check the quality of the product.	yes

总体不错，有点小问题	Overall, good, but a little problem.	yes
第一次购买滤水壶，看了几篇评价文章，感觉LAICA的性价比高些就选择了这个，收到货按说明书装好了滤芯，试用了一下，感觉总体不错，但是在倒水的时候好像原水会从壶嘴的地方与处理后的水混合（原水仓密封不太严）。	The first time I bought a water pump, I read some reviews, felt that the cost of LAICA was higher than the cost of this one, received the goods according to the instructions, the filter core was installed, tried it, it felt good overall, but when pouring the water, it seemed that the original water would mix with the treated water from the pump mouth (the original water storage is not sealed very strictly).	yes

9月23日晚上老婆手机摔了，心血来潮立马来亚马逊订购了一台8p，有货但是不是自营的且没有加价（心里暗喜），由于不是自营的发货比较慢，系统显示预计最晚收货要到9月27日。	On the night of September 23, my wife's phone fell off, and my heart raced.

买来之后其他的都没什么问题，就是在软件连接的时候，怎么都连不上，我家是TP的路由器，上网查了之后发现好多人都有这个问题，弄了两个多小时，各种改路由器的设置，最后我用360WIFI作为媒介给弄好的，期间给小米客服打电话，他们对这个问题也没有什么解决方法，直接就让我联系亚马逊进行售后。	After buying the other is no problem, is when the software connection, how can not connect, my home is TP's router, after searching the Internet found that many people have this problem, made more than two hours, various changes in the settings of the router, finally I use 360 WIFI as a medium to fix, during the call to the customer service, they have no solution to this problem, I just let me contact Amazon for after-sales.	yes

描述 (DESCRIPTION) C 和 C++ 编译器是集成的.他们都要用四个步骤中的一个或多个处理输入文件: 预处理(preprocessing), Hii(compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking) .	DESCRIPTION C and C++ compilers are integrated. They all handle the input file in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.	yes
源文件后级名标识源文件的语言, 但是对编译器来说, 后绥名控制着缺省设定:	The suffix name of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix name controls the default setting:	yes
gcc 认为预处理后的文件(.i) 是 c 文件, 并且设定 c 形式的连接，	gcc considers the preprocessed file ((.i) to be a c file, and sets the connection to the form c,	yes

.h 预处理器文件; 通常不出现在命令行上其他后级名的文件被传递给连接器 (Linker).通常包括:	.h preprocessor files; files that are not normally present under another name on the command line are passed to the linker. Typically these include:	no
.0 目标文件 (Object file)	.0 Object file	no
.a 归档库文件(Archive file)	This is an archive file.	no
除非使用了 -cec，-s, 或 -E 选项(或者编译错误阻止了完整的过程),否则连接总是最后的步骤.	Connections are always the last step, unless the -cec-, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error blocks the entire process).	no
在连接阶段中,所有对应于源程序的.e 文件，-1 库文件, 无法识别的文件名(包括指定的.o H 标文件和 .a 库文件)按命令行中的顺序传递给连接器选项 (OPTIONS)	At the connection stage, all.e files, -1 library files, unidentified filenames ((including the specified.o H files and.a library files corresponding to the source program) are passed to the connector options in the order of the command line.	no
选项必须分立给出 : de ' 完全不同于 `-d -r '.	The option must be given separately: de'is completely different from `-d-r '.	no
大多数 ` -=E :和 `-W' 选项有两个相反的格式 : -fname 和 -fno-name (或 -Wname 和 -Wno- name).	Most `-=E: and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).	no
这里只列举不是默认选项的格式.	The formats listed here are not the default options.	no
下面是所有选项的摘要, 按类型分组, 解释放在后面的章节中.	Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in later chapters.	no
代码生成选项 (Code Generation Option)	The code generation option	yes
总体选项 (Overall Option)	Overall option	yes
明确指出后面输入文件的语言为 language (而不是从文件名后绥得到的默认选择).	Make clear that the language of the file input is the language (rather than the default choice from the file name suffix).	yes
这个选项应用于后面所有的输入文件, 直到遇着下一个 `-x' 选项 .language 的可选	This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option is available in.language	yes
关闭任何对语种的明确说明, 因此依据文件名后级处理后面的文件 RE AS E ` -x' 选项).	Turn off any explicit language pronouncements that are consequent to the filename suffix processing the file behind the RE AS E ` -x' option).	yes
如果只操作四个阶段( 预处理, 编译, 汇编, 连接)中的一部分, 可以使用 ` -x' 选项 (或文件名后 Ah) 告诉 geo 从哪里开始,用 `~-c' ，`-s' ,或 `-E' 选项告诉 geo 到哪里结束.注意,某些选项组合 (例如 ，`-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c 编译或汇编源文件, ETER. ERA ATI 缺省情况下， GCC 通过用 ` .o' 蔡换源文件名后级 ` .ec 标文件名. 可以使用-o 选项选择其他名字.GCC忽略 -ec 选项后面任何无法识别的输入文伯 -S F 何事情.	If only part of the four steps (Preprocess, Compile, Compile, Connect) is operated, the ∀ -x' option (or Ah after the filename) can be used to tell geo where to begin, and the ∀~-c', `-s', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note that certain combinations of options (e.g., ∀-x cpp-output-E') {i gee MEF =c compile or compile a source file, ETER. In the absence of the ERA ATI, GCC uses a ▽.o' by replacing the source file name after the file name in the ∀.ec file name label. Other options can be used to choose a name.	yes
了的目标文件.	This is what happened to the target file.	yes
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	After compilation it stops, and no compilation is done.	yes
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	Because the compiler for those systems cannot read data from the pipeline, the compiler of GNU does not have this problem; the compiler can accept C "dialects" to work between different stages of the compilation process: it supports ANSI-compliant C programs.	yes
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This turns off certain keywords in GNU Cc that do not support ANSI Cc, as well as certain ANSI trigraph features that indicate proper and rarely used ANSI trigraph attributes such as unix and vax, and turns it off despite its usage in all standard libraries in a hosted environment. The main function returns an int value; typical examples are almost all programs except for the kernel. The corresponding free-standing environment does not have a standard library, nor is the program port necessarily main, the most obvious example being the kernel within the operating system.	yes
对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	Function declarations without arguments, e.g. `int foo (); ', treated in C style -- i.e. without specifying the number or type of arguments. (C++ only).	no
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	Normally, a function like foo means that the argument is empty in C++.	no
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	Section list is removed from here in an attempt to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.	no
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	The NU c manual details, which we have removed, so that when the content is out of date, people don't read it.	no
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the '∀ -traditional' option brings an additional effect, allowing this to be assigned.	no
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	He is the same as the result of the '`-Ethis-is-variable' option.	no
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.	no
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	In particular, the preprocessor mentioned above, but excluding the other effects of the '`-traditional' option.	no
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the character `$' in identifiers (for C++ only).	no
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	You can specify the `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of the ` $' character.	no
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	(GNU C++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not all.)	no
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of the ant type to the enumeration type (MEF c++).	no
正常情况下 GNU C++ 允许从 enum 到 int 的转换,反之则不行.	Under normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.	no
-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	-fexternal-templates -fexternal-templates produces small code for the template declaration (limited to c++), by generating one copy for each template function only where they are defined.	no
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	To successfully use this option, you must label in all files that use the template, `#pragma implementatio' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (statement).	no
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	When the program compiles with `-fexternal-templates', the template instantiation is all external type. You must have the required instances appear in the implementation file.	no
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	This can be done through typedef, which quotes each instance that is needed.	no
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	Correspondingly, if the default option used when compiling ` -fno-exteznal-templates', all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.	no
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All member functions (except the constructor subfunction and the mnew or delete member operator) are treated as virtual functions of the class they belong to.	no
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	This does not imply that every call to the member function will be through the internal null table.	no
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; then it does so.	no
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch Allows type mismatch of the second and third parameters of a conditional expression.	no
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-is-variable which allows this to be assigned a value (for c++ only).	no
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	The incorporation of user-defined free storage management mechanisms into c++ makes the attributable '`this' seem out of place.	no
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	Therefore, by default, the assignment of this is invalid inside the class member function.	no
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	However, for backward compatibility, you can enable this by selecting the '`-fthis-is-variable' option.	no
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	-funsigned-char Defines char as a symbolless type, like unsigned char.	no
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Each machine has its own default type of char. They can be either unsigned char or signed char.	no
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the symmetry of the data.	no
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	But many programs have been written using only simple char, and the endpoint is that with a symbol number ((or no symbol number, depending on the target machine for which the program is written).	no
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This option, and its antiderivative option, enables that program to work on the corresponding default value.	no
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	The type of char should always be clearly defined as a signed char or an unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.	no
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	If there is no explicitly declared ` signed' or "unsigned' modifier, these options are used to define bitfields with or without symbols.	no
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	By default, bit fields are signed because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed; however, if the '▽-traditional' option is specified, the bit fields are always unsigned.	no
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	-fwritable-strings stores string constants in a writable data segment without special treatment.	no
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	This is to be compatible with some old programs where it's a very bad idea to change string constants, the '`-traditional' option has the same effect.	no

Since restrictions on air passenger transport are imposed almost everywhere, the activity of supplying drugs on commercial air travel may have been completely interrupted.	no
尽管国际邮政供应链也受到了干扰，但利用暗网和货物邮寄进行贩运的活动可能会增加。	Though the international postal supply chain has been disrupted, the use of darknet and courier freight transport is likely to increase.	no
从长远来看，经济衰退和相关的封闭措施可能会打乱毒品市场。	In the long run, the recession and related closures could disrupt the drug market.	no

在过去二十年期间，发展中国家吸毒情况的增长速度远远快于发达国家。	Over the past two decades, drug use in developing countries has increased much faster than in developed countries.	no
这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。	This reflects partly differences in overall population growth during this period, 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also reflects the faster rise in young people in developing countries.	no
青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。	Adolescents and young adults are the largest proportion of drug users.	no
在2000-2018年期间，发展中国家这一年龄段的人口增长了16%,而发达国家这一年龄段的人口减少了10%。	Between 2000 and 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.	no
1城市化是当前和未来毒品市场的一个驱动因素	1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets	no
无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。	Drug use is higher in urban areas than in rural areas in both developed and developing countries.	no
吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。	This overall increase in drug use is partly attributable to the massive migration of people from rural to urban areas: more than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas, up from 34% in 1960.	no
城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。	Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization tendencies are more prominent.	no
财富的增加与吸毒情况增多相联，但承受疾病负担最大的是最贫穷的人在世界范围内，发达国家的吸毒情况比发展中国家更为普遍。	An increase in wealth is associated with an increase in drug use, but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the world's poorest people, and drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.	no

这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。	These patterns appear to be less common in the wealthier social classes.	no
全球新冠肺炎危机造成的经济制约很可能会加剧包括吸毒者在内的最弱势群体的风险。	The economic constraints created by the global coronavirus pneumonia crisis are likely to increase the risk to the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.	no
例如，劳动力市场的变化，如失业率上升，过去一直与吸毒情况的增加有关，而这场疫情己经迫使全球数千万人失业。	For example, changes in the labor market, like rising unemployment, have in the past been associated with an increase in drug use, an epidemic that has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide out of work.	no
新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。	Coronavirus or the pandemic would lead to the further expansion of the drug market Corona pneumonia might lead to more farmers or cultivation of illegal crops, or because of reduced control of the State competent organs or more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities under the economic crisis.	no
新冠肺炎的相关限制措施导致空中和陆路交通减少，海上贩运可能已经因此而增加，海上的拦截风险低，而且比空中或陆路走私的数量更多。	Related restrictions for COVID-19 resulted in reduced air and land traffic, maritime trafficking may have increased as a result, with a lower risk of interception on sea and greater numbers of cases of trafficking than air or land.	no

除大麻、可卡因和海洛因等植物类物质之外，已经增添了数百种合成毒品，其中许多并不在国际管制之下。药品的非医疗使用也快速增多。	In addition to plants and plant-derived substances such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. Non-medical use of drugs is also increasing rapidly.	yes
会员国的国内市场每年约有500种新型活性物质。	Approximately 500 new active substances are produced annually in the domestic market of the Member States.	yes
目前其中大多是兴奋剂，其次是合成的大麻素受体激动剂和少量的类阿片。	Currently, the majority are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small number of opioids.	yes
虽然新型精神活性物质的总体数量已经稳定下来，但比例发生了变化。	While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.	yes

2新型精神活性物质的使用可能会逐渐牢固存在于弱势群体中	2 The use of novel psychoactive substances may become more entrenched in vulnerable groups	no
单一种类的新型精神活性物质几乎从未形成大的市场。	However, a single class of new psychoactive substances has hardly ever generated a large market.	no
但来自欧洲的证据表明，合成大麻素在无家可归者和监狱囚犯等社会边缘群体中是一个严重的问题。	But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabis is a serious problem among socially marginalized groups, such as the homeless and prison inmates.	no
有22个国家报告了监狱中使用新型精神活性物质的情况，其中大多数国家将合成大麻素确定为主要挑战。	22 countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with the majority identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.	no
对前体化学品的管制迫使制毒者进行创新最常作为前体用来合成苯丙胺、甲基苯丙胺和“摇头丸”等毒品的许多化学品已被置于国际管制之下。	The regulation of precursor chemicals has forced drug makers to innovate: many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors for drugs such as ketamine, methylamine, and amphetamines have been placed under international control.	no
贩毒者和制毒者一直在寻找替代品一不仅有管制较松的物质，还有专门为规避管制而设计的化学品，即所谓的“特制前体”。	Drug dealers and manufacturers have been looking for alternatives to not only the more loosely controlled substances, but chemicals specifically designed to circumvent control, the so-called special rubber precursors.	no
旨在阻止新冠肺炎传播的限制性措施很可能使依赖前体化学品的制毒者受到进一步挤压。	Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia are likely to further squeeze out poisoners who rely on precursor chemicals.	no
来自墨西哥的证据表明，这已经成为 现实：据报告，2020年3月，从东亚进口的甲基苯丙胺前体短缺促使墨西哥和美国的甲基苯丙胺价格上涨。	Evidence from Mexico shows that this is already a reality: in March 2020, it was reported that a shortage of methylamine precursors imported from East Asia spurred a price spike in Mexico and the United States.	no
市场瞬息万变	The market is always changing	no
合成药物在中亚和俄罗斯联邦取代阿片剂	Synthetic drugs replace opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation	no

早在2012年，对医院、监狱和其他机构人员的调查就已经揭示了甲基苯丙胺在伊拉克的重要性。	As early as 2012, surveys of hospital, prison, and other institutions staff have revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.	no
结晶甲基苯丙胺已经成为“芬乃他林”和曲马多之外又一种令人担忧的主要药物。	Crystal methamphetamine has become a major drug of concern, alongside dopamine, natriurethane and quetiapine.	no
2015年的一项研宄进一步证实了这些发现，吸毒者表示大麻比“芬乃他林”或甲基苯丙胺更难获得。	A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with users reporting that cannabis is more difficult to obtain than methamphetamine or methamphetamine.	no
最近，伊拉克当局发现了多个甲基苯丙胺加工点，麻管局已对伪麻黄碱制剂的大批进口表示关切一甲基苯丙胺加工点将这些制剂用作前体。	Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine processing plants, and the Cannabis Bureau has expressed concern about the large-scale import of synthetic methamphetamine preparations which are used by some of the methamphetamine processing plants as precursors.	no
在阿富汗，甲基苯丙胺制造似乎始于2014年。	In Afghanistan, methamphetamine production seems to have started in 2014.	no
自那时起，甲基苯丙胺的缉获量一直在稳步上升。	Since then, methamphetamine seizures have been steadily increasing.	no
但2019年上半年的缉获量一^657公斤——与上一年相比大幅骤增。	However, in the first half of 2019, the volume of the catch was 657kg, an increase compared to the previous year.	no
在其他国家大量缉获了据认为源自阿富汗的甲基苯丙胺，这也表明该国的产量正在迅速上升。	The massive seizures of methylamine in other countries, believed to be from Afghanistan, also show that production in the country is increasing rapidly.	no
政策变化和变化趋势	Policy changes and trends	yes
非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域大多有大麻使用增多的趋势	Cannabis use is increasing in most jurisdictions that have legalized nonmedical use	yes
加拿大、乌拉圭和美国的11个法域允许制造大麻产品供非医疗使用。	The manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use is permitted in 11 jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay, and the United States.	yes
在其中多数法域，大麻使用自合法化以来有所增多，尽管在其他未将非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域也观察到了同样的趋势。	In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend is observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical cannabis use.	yes
在美国最早通过立法的两个州科罗拉多州和华盛顿州，成年人非医疗使用大麻的情况增加，特别是过去一个月以及每天或几乎每天使用的情况增多，自2012年起便已超过了全国平均水平。	In the first two states to pass legislation, Colorado and Washington, non-medical use among adults has increased, particularly over the past month, as well as daily or near-daily use, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.	yes
所有指标都显示，自2011年以来，乌拉圭的大麻使用情况有所增加，上月使用情况几乎翻了一番。	All indicators show that the use of cannabis in Uruguay has increased since 2011, almost doubling in the past month.	yes
这表明增加的主要原因是经常和频繁使用大麻。	This indicates that the main reason for the increase is regular and frequent cannabis use .	yes
加拿大的短期数据也表明，2018年至2019年合法市场扩大的同时，使用量也在增加。	Short-term data from Canada also shows that while the legal market expanded, use also grew between 2018 and 2019.	yes
然而，2019年仍有40%的大麻使用者靠非法来源获得某些产品。	However, 40% of cannabis users were still obtaining some products from illegal sources in 2019.	yes
全球大麻药草缉获量暴跌的背后原因是大麻合法化？	Could the legalization of marijuana be the reason behind the global plunge in the harvest of cannabis strains?	yes
2018年，全球大麻药草缉获量降至20年来的最低水平，这是因为北美的缉获量下降，在过去10年中下降了 84%。	In 2018, global harvest of marijuana straw fell to the lowest level in 20 years, due to declining harvest in North America, which fell 84% in the past 10 years.	no
相比之下，同期世界其他地区的缉获量几乎翻了一番。缉获的模式表明，旨在放开大麻市场的政策在下降中发挥了关键作用。	By comparison, seizures in the rest of the world nearly doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the marijuana market have played a key role in the decline.	no
对新型精神活性物质的监管似乎有遏制作用在国内对新型精神活性物质的监管效果仍然很难评估。	The effectiveness of the regulation of new psychoactive substances in the country is still difficult to assess.	no
一些对新型精神活性物质采用不同监管制度的国家显示出不同的新型精神活性物质使用流行率。	Several countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different rates of new psychoactive substance use.	no

大约50%在北美，40%在欧洲，还有2%在大洋洲。	About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.	no
这些国家的人口约占全球人口的12%。	These countries account for about 12% of the world's population.	no
据估计，低收入和中等收入国家的人口占全球人口的88%,但消费的药用类阿片却不到10%。	It is estimated that 88% of the world's population lives in low- and middle-income countries, yet less than 10% of medicinal opioids are consumed.	no
获取药用类阿片的障碍与许多因素有关，包括立法、文化、卫生系统和处方做法。	Barriers to access to medical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.	no
较贫穷的人患吸毒病症的风险更大2018年约有3,560万人患有吸毒病症。	Poorer people are at higher risk of developing drug-related illness. About 35.6 million people suffer from drug-related illness in 2018 [2].	no
贫困、有限的教育和社会边缘化可能会增加吸毒病症风险，并加剧其后果。高收入国家的研宄证实了这一点，在这些研究中，个人不利的社会经济轨迹一不仅仅是他们在某一时间点的状况一也与吸毒病症风险有关。	Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorders and its consequences. Studies in high-income countries confirm this, as in these studies individuals' adverse socio-economic trajectories are related to the risk of drug use disorders, not just their situation at a certain time in their lives.	no
吸毒病症还会加深社会经济劣势，进一步增加失业、贫困和无家可归的风险，从而助长劣势的恶性循环。这些结果也可能与刑事司法系统内的侮辱性态度和后果有关。	Drug dependence also increases socioeconomic disadvantages, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby contributing to a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to abusive attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.	no
妇女、少数民族和移民、性取向多样化群体、因武装冲突或灾难而流离失所的人以及农村环境中的人也可能受到吸毒病症的过重影响，或者在获得治疗服务方面遇到问题。	Women, minorities and migrants, diverse groups of sexual orientation, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster and those in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug use disorders or have difficulty in accessing treatment services.	no
根据估计因残疾和过早死亡而损失的健康寿命年数的残疾调整寿命年（DALY)指标，在过去10年中，有害的吸毒对范围更广的社会影响加重。	In the past decade the social impact of harmful drug use on wider society has increased, according to the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) index, which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death.	no
2007年至2018年间，归因于吸毒的全球残疾调整寿命年数增加了 17%。	Global disability-adjusted life expectancy attributed to drug use increased by 17% between 2007 and 2018 [2].	no
注射吸毒者中常见的未经治疗的丙型肝炎导致的肝癌的相关残疾调整寿命年数增幅特别高——达到40%。	The disability adjusted years of life associated with liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C, common among injection drug users, are particularly high at 40%.	no
毒品和暴力之间的关系错综复杂很难确定精神活性物质的使用和暴力之间的所有因果关系。	The relationship between drugs and violence is complex, and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between psychoactive substance use and violence.	no
全球范围的有限数据表明，迷醉可能是杀人的一个重要因素。	Limited worldwide data suggest that binge drinking may be a significant factor in deaths.	no
但在暴力事件中，酒精的作用似乎比毒品更大。	However, alcohol seems to be playing a greater role in violence than drugs.	no
虽然吸毒可能会导致犯罪，但在某些情况下，这种联系可以部分归因于多种中介因素，如社会经济劣势以及由个人风险、家庭环境和同龄人影响造成的其他类型的逆境。	While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases the link can be partly attributed to multiple intermediate factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and peer pressure.	no
贩毒和暴力之间的联系是多方面的。	The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.	no
如果已有稳定的犯罪结构，包括国际贩毒在内的大规模有组织犯罪活动有可能在无暴力的情况下实施。	Where there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, are likely to be carried out in a nonviolent manner.	no
短期内，暴力的存在和程度与其说取决于贩运的数量，不如说取决于造成有组织犯罪集团之间力量平衡不稳定的某些变化，例如非法市场规模的变化，知名罪犯的死亡或监禁，以及使一个集团弱于另一个集团的执法措施。	In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depend less on the quantity of trafficking than on certain shifts that destabilize the balance of power among organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or incarceration of known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group over another.	no
最新趋势	The latest trends	yes
吸毒大麻是最常用的物质，类阿片危害最大	Marijuana is the most commonly used drug, and opioids are the most dangerous	yes
据估计，2018年使用大麻的有 1.92 亿人，使之成为全球使用最多的毒品。	An estimated 189 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.	yes
相比之下，2018年使用类阿片的有5,800万人。	In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.	yes
但阿片类药物的相关危害却因使用者较少而受到忽视。	However, the associated dangers of opioids are ignored as fewer people take them.	yes
在2017年与吸毒病症有关的估计167,000例死亡中，有66%是这类物质造成的，在据信为吸毒导致的残疾或过早死亡而损失的2,100万年寿命中，有50%是这类物质造成的。	Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to substance use disorders in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances and 50% of the 21 million years of life lost by disability or premature death believed to be due to drug use.	yes
合成类阿片的非医疗使用加剧了公共卫生危机	Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates the public health crisis	yes
在西非、中部非洲和北非，加剧类阿片危机的是曲马多；在北美则是芬太尼。这两个区域在经济、人口统计数据或一般吸毒模式方面几乎没有共同点，但都在奋力抗击由容易获得且生产成本低的物质助长的类阿片危机。	In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, Kumamoto is the acute opioid crisis; in North America, it is Fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economics, demographics or general patterns of drug use, but all are working hard to combat a opioid crisis fueled by the easy availability and low-cost production of the drug.	yes
在北美，芬太尼等合成类阿片的使用导致了20年来类阿片过量致死人数增加。	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.	yes
2018年，在美国登记的67,367例过量死亡中，有三分之二涉及芬太尼。	In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths reported in the United States were related to fentanyl.	yes
加拿大也报告了类似的结果，只是数字较低。	Canada reported similar results, but with lower numbers.	no
芬太尼导致过量死亡的部分原因是非法药物市场上的芬太尼药效不可预测。	Fentanyl overdoses are caused in part by the unpredictability of fentanyl in the illicit drug market.	no
在西非、中部非洲和北非，非医疗用途曲马多的市场已有大幅增长。	In West, Central and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of cumin has been growing significantly.	no
在该区域，接受治疗的曲马多使用病症患者越来越多。	A growing number of patients with comedo-therapy-associated conditions are being treated in the region.	no
2017年，全球截获的曲马多数量显著增加，达到125吨以上的峰值。	In 2017, the number of seized Kumano horse worldwide increased significantly, reaching a peak of over 125 tons.	no
但2018年，在印度通过一项监管曲马多的新法律之后，全球缉获量降至32吨。	But in 2018, the global catch was reduced to 32 tons after India passed a new law to regulate gametes.	no
促成这两地危机的是制造简单和生产成本低，此外还有对曲马多和许多芬太尼类似物或其前体缺乏国际监管。	These two crises are due to simplicity of manufacture and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation for the Quimado and many of its analogues or precursors.	no
使这两地危机恶化的是这些物质在药品市场和非法市场上都有供应，因而更加难以发现和防止其滥用。	What exacerbates these crises is that these substances are available on both the drug and illicit markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent misuse.	no
兴奋剂使用不断增多	Increased use of stimulants	no
兴奋剂领域以可卡因和甲基苯丙胺为主，这两种物质在其主要市场的使用量都在上升。	The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasingly used in their main markets.	no
2018年使用可卡因的约有1,900万人，因为可卡因在北美和西欧颇为流行。	Some 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine became increasingly popular in North America and Western Europe.	no
同年使用苯丙胺的约有2,700万人，其中甲基苯丙胺是东南亚和北美使用最多的苯丙胺类兴奋剂。	Around 27 million people used ketamine in the same year, with methyl ketamine being the most widely used ketamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.	no
根据所掌握的多数指标，20年来这两个区域甲基苯丙胺的使用一直在扩大。	According to most indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two areas has been increasing for the last 20 years.	no
在一些市场上，可卡因和甲基苯丙胺可以共存，有时是相互替代，这样一种药物的使用量上升时另一种药物的使用量就下降，有时是同时增加和减少以满足同一市场的需求。	In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine co-exist and sometimes replace each other, such that the use of one drug decreases as use of the other rises, sometimes simultaneously increasing and decreasing to meet the demand of the same market.	no
新冠肺炎使注射吸毒者的风险增高	Coronavirus pneumonia increases the risk for injecting drug users	no
据估计，2018年注射吸毒的约有1,130万人，全球艾滋病毒感染约有10%是注射吸毒造成的。	It is estimated that around 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018 and around 10% of HIV infections globally were caused by injecting drug use.	no
注射吸毒者感染艾滋病毒的超过100万人，患丙型肝炎的有550万人。	More than one million people are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million with hepatitis C.	no
2017年，因吸毒死亡的约有 58.5万人，其中一半死于丙型肝炎引起的肝病，而注射吸毒者的丙型肝炎大多仍未得到治疗。	In 2017, approximately 585,000 people died from drug use, half of these from liver disease caused by hepatitis C. Most hepatitis C in injecting drug users remain untreated.	no
5 新冠肺炎限制措施造成的类阿片短缺可能导致使用者代之以酒精或苯二氮类药物等更容易获得的物质，或者将类阿片与合成药物混合。	5 The opioid shortage due to restrictions on necoronary pneumonia may lead users to switch to more easily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.	no
随着一些使用者改用注射或更频繁地注射，可能会出现更多有害的使用方式。	There may be more harmful uses as some users switch to injections or inject more frequently.	no

欧盟峰会为难民政策争吵不休，欧盟官员：接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈	EU summit clashes over refugee policy, EU officials: There are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process	yes
【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	At the latest EU summit of the day, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that EU leaders agreed to introduce tougher policies on illegal immigration to make it easier to deport illegal migrants.	yes
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	The EU's move reportedly responds to concerns about the growing problem of illegal migration in Europe, where the core issue of the EU is the small number of illegal migrants who ultimately could be repatriated.	yes
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	According to the summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to immediately mobilize large amounts of EU funds to strengthen the external border by means such as infrastructure and surveillance.	yes
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	However, the EU and member states argue over issues such as the payment of fences.	yes
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	Weiderlein has repeatedly stated that the EU funds will not cover the fees.	yes
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	But diplomats from a number of member states say that if the EU were to share the cost of installing cameras, observation towers and other infrastructure along the external border, it would free up national budgets and speed up construction.	yes
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	EU officials acknowledged that there are bottlenecks in every step of the reception process, with limited reception capacity and overwhelmed migration authorities in member countries failing to stop refugees from submitting large numbers of asylum applications across the EU, and that the EU's reception system is in near-permanent crisis, according to EurActiv.	yes
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, almost half as many as the previous year.	yes
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.	no
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	In this context, the summit also reached an agreement on the principle of reciprocity: EU countries can return illegal migrants on the basis of a judgement issued by a court in another member state.	no
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	EU leaders also agreed to increase the use of the concept of the safe state, which would pave the way for the EU to create a common list, the report said.	no

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	U.S. upgrade of silicon chips hits the global semiconductor industry hard	yes
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	Recently, the US war on China's silicon chips has been intensified, with the Netherlands, Japan under pressure from the US to start regulating the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, foreign media reported that the US government is considering cutting all ties between US suppliers and Huawei companies and banning US suppliers from supplying any products to Huawei, and the Biden administration is preparing to publish an executive order restricting US investment in the sensitive Chinese tech industry.	yes
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	In recent years, the United States has never stopped fighting against China's silicon and nickel development, while cracking down on the supply chain of semiconductor products from China, and building a semiconductor industry chain alliance to rival China's silicon, trying to completely open China in advanced semiconductor industry.	yes
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it is to establish a silicon technology alliance with Korea, or to establish a silicon four-way alliance with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan in China, or to establish a semiconductor industry chain link through such mechanisms as the US-Japanese-Indian-Ausralian quadrilateral mechanism and the Printing Sea Economic Framework link, the United States intends to build a closed production and supply chain cycle dominated by the United States by introducing politicisation, campaigning and weaponisation into the semiconductor industry, thereby making up for its shortcomings in the field of chip production and maintaining its dominant position in the global chip industry.	yes
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	However, the U.S.'s tactical success against China has resulted in a loss of over 1,800 tons.	yes
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	Recently, PanLin Group, a well-known US chip equipment supplier, announced that as a result of the latest round of export bans on Chinese chip manufacturing equipment, it will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plan to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.	yes
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	The global photometer giant Asmar Holding, a Dutch company, recently warned that a ban on exporting semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.	yes
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	US media analysis, after the US government cracked down on industries such as Chinese chip and semiconductor, many American companies suffered greatly, including developers of electronic design automation tools, chip designers, manufacturers of crystal manufacturing equipment, and chip manufacturers themselves.	yes
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	The United States, which claims to be suppressing China's advanced semiconductor industry, has dragged water down the global semiconductor industry and supply chain.	yes
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a highly technological and knowledge-intensive industry that has long formed a close-knit global semiconductor industry chain.	yes
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	According to experts, the entire production process of semiconductor products based on specialized division of labour requires crossing the boundaries of countries more than 70 times and up to 100 days.	no
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong base, it is weak in manufacturing capacity, especially for advanced manufacturing processes, and heavily dependent on East Asia.	no
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	Even if the U.S. steers its advanced chip supply chain toward U.S.-led small-circulation regionalisation, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor industry is very difficult to change.	no
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The United States is going to reshape the semiconductor industry chain from China to the Americas, and reshape the global semiconductor industry.	no
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	The chip industry is the heart of the global future and all countries around the globe will participate in the development of the chip industry.	no
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, including the introduction of the Innovation and Competition Act, 2022 (US Competition Act) and the Science Act of 2022, to use technological hegemony, to consolidate its technological leadership, to encourage its allies and to pressure chip manufacturers like Intel, TSMC and Samsung to establish plants in the United States, and to ensure the U.S.'s global leadership in the chip field.	no
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	In the short term, the United States has indeed created problems for China's chip industry and related industry development, and reaped real benefits.	no
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	But in the long run, the hysterical crackdown by US companies on the Chinese chip industry and its breakthroughs will cost them the huge Chinese market, ultimately weakening the innovation will and ability of US technology companies and damaging the development of the global chip industry.	no

又一大型健身房“暴雷”？	Another big gym and thunderstorms?	yes
近日，知名健身机构中健健身会员维权问题引起社会关注。	Recently, there has been a lot of public attention for the rights of members in well-known fitness institutions.	yes
春节后不少会员发现自己所在门店没有正常营业，随后，关于该机构倒闭跑路的传闻引起会员恐慌，导致公安、人社部门介入。	After the Spring Festival, many members found that their shops were not operating normally; later, rumors about the organization's collapse of the runway caused panic among the members, resulting in the intervention of the Public Security and the Social Department.	yes
最后，该机构相关负责人出面回应，承诺会努力保障好员工和会员的合法权益，风波才得以平息。	Finally, the official from the agency responded by promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of its employees and members, and the situation is relieved.	yes
个别健身机构的部分门店出现经营问题，暂时关闭，消费者本可心平气和等待问题解决，为何不少会员的第一反应是“大事不妙”？	The initial reaction from many members is that why is it that a part of the physical fitness outlets were affected and were temporarily closed, so consumers can relax and wait for the problem to be solved, which is a big deal, or not.	yes
健身俱乐部会员维权风波背后，是行业信任危机的深层次问题。	The biggest cause of the rise of fitness club membership is a deep crisis of confidence in the industry.	yes
国内传统健身房普遍采取预付费模式，“赚用户不来的钱”是其发展的底层逻辑。	The country's traditional gyms generally take the prepaid model, and the money from their customers is the underlying logic behind their development.	yes
通过预售会员卡获取现金流，不断开新店，看似能够循环往复，实则寅吃卯粮，无法形成稳定的盈利模式。	By opening new stores to raise cash through membership cards, they seem to be able to cycle back and forth, but in reality are simply hungry for food without a stable profit model.	yes
健身房跑路等行业负面信息频频传出，对消费者信心造成强烈冲击。	The negative news about such sectors like the gym runs is often broadcast, and this has a strong impact on consumer confidence.	yes
从市场前景看，健身房当然算得上是一门有“钱途”的好生意。	From a market perspective, the gym is certainly a profitable business.	no
健身赛道虽然起起伏伏，但始终受到资本关注。	With its ups and downs, the fitness circuit has always been the focus of capital.	no

形势越是趋好，行业越需重视发展质量。	The more the situation improves, the more the industry needs to pay attention to quality of development.	no
然而，个别机构对消费复苏后的健身市场盲目乐观，刚从危机中走出来，又吹响开疆拓土的号角，把融资资金一股脑投入新店建设上。	However, some agencies have been blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumption revival. They have just emerged from the crisis and sounded the bells of the opening up of the territory, investing part of the financing in the construction of new stores.	no
不可否认，这几年受疫情影响，不少机构退出，行业重新洗牌，有实力的企业此时选择性地加大收购力度、重新布局，未尝不是新机遇。	As we have seen in recent years, with the pandemic, there is no denying that the withdrawal of many institutions, the industry reshuffle, and the strong companies are selectively increasing their purchasing power and re-design, which is not a new opportunity.	no
但是，健身市场发展要想进入良性循环，迈上行稳致远的康庄大道，行业就必须改变传统模式，改变经营策略。	But if the fitness market is to enter a healthy cycle and take the road to prosperity, the industry must change its traditional model and change its strategy.	no
只有稳扎稳打，重新建立起消费者的信任度、安全感，才能真正赢得市场、赢得未来。	Only by standing firm and rebuilding trust, trust and security among the consumers can we truly win the market and win the future.	no
相比大建新店抢占市场，健身行业当前更需要的是沉下心来优化服务，用高质量发展来稳住用户。	As opposed to the new stores that are being built to capture the market, the fitness industry needs to focus on optimizing services and developing high quality to retain customers.	no
首先，要靠服务留住用户。	First of all, keep users on the service.	no
健身房属于服务行业，其本质是坚持“用户导向”，要紧紧围绕用户需求，把经营重心放在服务提质升级上。	The gym is part of service industry, its essence is to stick to user-oriented, to focus on the needs of users, to focus its operations on improving the quality of services.	no
其次，要靠数字化转型提升用户体验。	Second, to improve the user experience through digital transformation.	no
比如当下流行的互联网健身房模式，实现用户按次付费和场地自选。	One is the current popular internet gym model that allows users to pay by the hour and choose the venue themselves.	no
同时，身体数据、运动数据得以有效利用，还可以满足社交需求，实现从线上到线下完整的服务闭环。	At the same time, physical and sports data can be effectively used to meet social needs and achieve complete services from online to offline.	no
没有私教推销，没有巨额年卡，用户对健身机构“跑路”的担忧降低了，信任感也就提升了。	There are no private tuition sales, no huge annual cards, the fear of people running around the gym has been reduced and a sense of trust increased.	no
另外，还要积极探索多元业态。	It is also necessary to actively explore the diverse professions:	no
如今，体育消费已经从单一服务走向场景消费，健身俱乐部有望成为消费新入口，围绕健身所需的运动补给和健身器械等周边产品或将成为新的盈利点，为消费者提供更丰富选择。	Today, sports consumption has shifted from one service to scene consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point, and peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment surrounding the fitness required or will become a new lever for consumers to have a greater choice.	no

南京楼市再现“差价赔付”-中新网	Nanjing property market to pay for the price discrepancy.	yes
扬子晚报讯(记者 马祚波)扬子晚报/紫牛新闻记者10日在采访中发现，十余年未见的“保价协议”又重回了南京楼市，位于江北新区的一家楼盘宣称“差价赔付”，在交房前其他房源的优惠大于之前的折扣，开发商愿意为买房人换房并退还差价。	Yangzhou Evening News (Journalist: Ma Jun) Yangzhou Evening News / Zhongyuan News found in interview on the 10th, not seen for more than ten years, the price guarantee agreement for the roof has returned to the Nanjing real estate market, a building in Jiangbei New District claiming that the price of the damages compensation for the roof, before handing over other housing sources are more favorable than the previous discount, the developer is willing to buy housing for people change and reimburse the price.	yes
“保价协议”条件可不少	The price guarantee agreement has a number of conditions:	yes

他发给记者的图片上显示，该楼盘的开发商承诺，凡是在2月1日-2月28日期间购买房源的，自双方签订买卖合同之日起至对应房源交付，若该项目其他房源的优惠折扣大于之前购房所享折扣的(限与该商品房属于同一户型、同一楼栋、同一单元、同一物业类型的其他未售商品房)，开发商可以为购房者换房并退还差价。	According to the photographs, which he sent out to reporters, the developer of the property promised that anyone who had purchased the property between February 1st and February 28th, from the date of the contract of sale, to the date of the delivery, if the discount of the other homes on the project is greater than the discount of previous purchases (... other unsold commodities of the same type, the same building, the same unit, the same property type), the developer can change rooms for the buyer of the house and refund the difference in price.	yes
孙先生表示，置业顾问表示这其实就是一份“保价协议”，目的是让买家放心出手，不用担心开发企业降价促销，“现在就怕买完了它就降价了，去售楼处闹吧没时间，不闹的话也确实窝心”。	Mr. Son said that the real estate agent said that this is a price guarantee agreement, the purpose of which is to give the buyer the confidence to do it without having to worry about a development company discount promotion, they are now afraid of buying it and cut it, they do not have time to go to the sales department and they are not worried about it.	yes
还有不少买房人则认为，“保价协议”虽然是在给购房者吃“定心丸”，不过条件却不低。	It is true that a lot of buyers believe that the price guarantee agreement provides buyers with a certain security, but its conditions are not bad.	yes
打算在江北买一套刚需房的郑女士说，保价的房源首先是要同一户型，还得在同一楼栋、同一个单元，买家可以比价的房源寥寥，因此“门槛”还是蛮高的。	Mrs. Yang, who intends to buy a house in Jiangbei, said the guarantee price is first and foremost the same type of house, also in the same building and the same unit, the buyer can compare the price of the home to the source of the price, so the threshold is quite high.	yes
也有购房者认为，由于信息不对称，销售时不排除给出额外的让利，买家“维权”的难度不小。	Some buyers argue that because there is an asymmetry of information, the possibility of extra concessions is not ruled out and that it will be difficult for the buyer to defend their rights.	yes
能否留住买房人有待观察	If the buyer remains, it remains to be seen.	no
记者在南京网上房地产上查询得知，该楼盘于去年11月首领两幢楼共计252套房源的销许，户型面积有105平方米、114平方米、129平方米等，全装修销许均价为39843元/㎡。	According to the report on the property in Nanjing, which was the first in November last year, the property has a total of 252 units in the first two buildings of the building, with a total area of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, and the average price for the newly renovated building is 39843 yuan / m2.	no
不过两个多月过去，网上房地产显示目前该楼盘的未售总套数为157套，占比为62.3%，其中8号楼共计128套，未售套数达113套，7号楼的124套中也有44套未售，项目的总成交套数只有33套，占比仅为13%。	However, two months later, online real estate showed that the property is still 157 units, which accounts for 62.3%, with the total number of 128 units on the 8th floor, 113 units, and 44 out of the 124 units on the 7th floor, and only 33 units in the total number of units, which accounts for 13%.	no
市场人士介绍，“保价协议”在2008年也曾在南京出现过。	The price guarantee agreement also happened in Nanjing in 2008, according to market sources.	no
当年8月份，河西黄山路上的楼盘横塘西苑为了吸引买房人眼球，推出了《保价计划》，具体内容为“公司郑重承诺，若一年内项目优惠幅度扩大，由此产生的差额，公司将按差额退还给老业主”。	In August of that year, in order to attract house-buyers, the company launched a price guarantee program, with specific terms for the company's strong commitment, if the project's concessions were expanded within a year, the company would return the difference to the old owners, according to the difference.	no
此后2011年4月，南京也有9家楼盘拿出部分房源承诺“差价赔付”。	Since then, in April 2011, nine other properties in Nanjing have also offered to pay the difference in rent between their respective locations.	no
“楼市在回暖，此时更需要一针‘强心剂’。	As the housing market is warming up, there is a need for an injectable pacemaker.	no
”南京地产行业一位资深操盘手沈先生表示，“保价协议”也是房企的营销方式之一。	Mr. Shen, a veteran operator in the real estate industry in Nanjing, said that the price guarantee is one of the marketing techniques for the company.	no
他认为如今开发企业比买房人更需要信心，推出“保价协议”其实也是在给其打气。	He believes that developers now need confidence more than homebuyers do, and the introduction of the price guarantee protocol is actually an incentive for them.	no
至于能否留住买房人，他表示这取决于调控政策、贷款门槛等多重因素的影响，就目前来看仍有待观察。	As for whether to keep the buyers, he said it would depend on the effect of several factors, such as regulatory policies and lending threshold, which remains to be seen at this stage.	no

同时，订单减少导致厂商削减人力成本，影响劳动市场和家庭经济，反过来冲击消费能力。	At the same time, the falling orders are leading manufacturers to cut their labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, in turn, impacting consumer spending power.	no
台湾经济研究院研究员邱达生认为，今年欧美通胀状况未解，需求持续萎缩，预估台湾出口衰退会延续到上半年。	According to Tsai Da-shi, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economics, the inflation situation in the US and Europe this year is unclear, demand remains at a standstill, and Taiwan's export slump is expected to continue into the first half of the year.	no

报告认为，电商行业内容生态是一个综合性概念，是将电商与内容进行整合，但并非所有内容都可与电商整合，好的PGC(专业生产内容)与UGC(用户原创内容)才是与电商进行整合的优质载体，内容平台价值越高，消费与推广的场景也就越来越丰富，电商植入的可能性也就越高，商业价值也就越强，这种公共领域和私人领域逐步集成分布的电商内容生产和内容消费的比例也就会越高。	According to the report, the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept, which is to integrate e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce, good PGC ((professional production content) and UGC ((user original content) is the quality carrier for integration with e-commerce, the higher the value of the content platform, the more abundant the scenes for consumption and promotion, the higher the probability of e-commerce implantation, the stronger the commercial value, the higher the proportion of e-commerce content production and consumption of content gradually incorporated in public and private sectors.	no

展望电商行业的未来发展，喻国明提出两方面的建议。	Looking ahead to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Li Qiongming presents two recommendations:	no

然而，第一夫人李雪主只能退到一旁。	The first lady, Lee Hsien Loong, however, can only step back.	yes
综合韩国“朝鲜新闻”等报导，金正恩、李雪主夫妇7日带著女儿金主爱出席晚宴的官方合照中，金主爱不仅罕见坐在父母正中间C位，在隔日晚间建军节第75周年阅兵仪式上，她还与金正恩一起登上主席台。	In an official photo taken of Kim Jong Un and his wife Lee Hyun-hee at a dinner with their daughter Kim Hyun-hye on July 7, Kim Hyun-hye not only rarely sits in C-seat in the middle of his parents but she also took the chairman's desk with Kim Jong-il during the parade for the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army (KPR) on the following night.	yes
朝鲜官媒“朝鲜中央电视台”事后释出阅兵式影片，曝光了更多父女情深的画面。	Official North Korean media released a video of a military parade on North Korean Central Television in the aftermath of the tragedy, revealing more intimate scenes of the couple's father and daughter.	yes
金正恩在主席台上数次与女儿对望，两人脸上的笑容从未退去，还互相在耳边讲悄悄话，金主爱一度以双手捧起老爸的两颊，金正恩也以灿笑回应。	Kim Jong Un looked at her daughter a couple of times on the podium, and the smiles on their faces never returned and they whispered in each other's ears, and Kim Jong Il held up his father's arms with his hands, while Kim Jong Un responded with a laugh.	yes
其他官媒画面也显示，金主爱与金正恩坐在室内沙发椅上时，用手不断摸著父亲的脸；她与父亲挽著手走路时，一边用手摸在金正恩的胸口。	Other official media images showed Kim Jae Hee and Kim Jong Un, sitting on a sofa chair in an apartment, touching their father's face with their hands; and her hand touching Kim Jong Un's chest while walking, holding hands with him.	yes

韩国媒体指出，金主爱自去年11月18日试射火星17飞弹首次在公开露脸以来，3个月以来曝光机率越来越高，至今已是第5度出现于正式场合。	The Korean media has noted that Kim Jong Un's exposure has been increasing for the past three months since his first public appearance at the launch of the Mars 17 rocket on November 18 last year, and this is his fifth appearance in public to date.	yes
朝鲜官媒提及金主爱时使用了最亲爱的子弟、尊贵的子弟等极高尊称，也播出金主爱在看台上俯瞰阅兵行进时反覆高喊誓死拥护白头血统的片段。	The North Korean state media has used honorifics such as "dearest son" and "dearest noble son" when referring to Kim Jong-un, and has broadcast footage of Kim repeatedly shouting swears to defend the Caucasian heritage while the leader watches the parade from the podium.	no
这些迹象让外界怀疑金主爱是否已经被内定为金氏政权的继承人，《华盛顿邮报》分析认为“这是金正恩把中学年纪的女儿推上接班人地位的讯号”，不过也有观点认为，这样的判断仍为时过早，在金正恩膝下有儿子的情况中，仍保有各种可能性。	Those signs raise doubts whether Kim Jong-il is already designated as the heir to the Kim clan. The Washington Post's analysis sees this as a sign that Kim Jong-un is pushing his middle school-age daughter to succeed him, though there are some who believe such judgment is premature and that there are still various possibilities in the case of a son under Kim Jong-un.	no
重阳问答︱如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	The U.S. nonfarm employment data in January exceeds expectations and future trends - Economic Observatory Network - Professional financial news website	yes
Q：请问重阳投资，如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势？	Q: How do you feel about the bigger than expected nonfarm employment data in January and future trends for China?	yes
A：2月3日美国劳工部公布2023年1月非农就业数据，新增非农就业51.7万人，大幅高于市场预期的18.9万人；失业率降至3.4%，为近50年以来的最低位；时薪同比增速4.4%，环比增速0.3%，略有放缓。	A: January 3, 2021 U.S. Department of Labor nonfarm employment data for January 2023; 5.17,000 new nonfarm jobs, significantly above the 189,000 market expectation; unemployment rate decreased to 3.4%, the lowest level in almost 50 years; hourly wage growth 4.4%, compound annual growth 0.3%, slightly slower.	yes
从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	In total, the data is distorted by a number of one-off and technical factors, such as striking teachers who have been on strike, a modification to the survey caliber and an update of the seasonal factors, which may be corrected later ((reference January 2022 non-farm growth is from 504,000 to 364,000) and the employment of non-farm people may not be as strong as the data shows.	yes
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	Structurally, the impact of cuts in high-tech firms is still there, but at a lower rate, with significant new employment increases in high-touch service sectors such as leisure hospitality, education and healthcare, with data showing that there remains a labor gap in the service sector.	yes
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Combined with the likewise over-expected recovery of service PMI, job vacancies and labor gap data, and the strength of the consumer credit data, we judge that the US services industry has been able to recover very quickly after the extreme weather and holiday season.	yes
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	We believe that the supply and demand tensions in the US labor market will be hard to improve without a recession.	yes
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	Currently, the U.S. labor market is over 5 million short-term job vacancies, and the labor force participation rate is slowly rising, especially among the 25-54 age group which is now approaching the pre-pandemic highs.	yes
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	Beyond this, stronger consumer demand due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit of residents of the United States will further delay the impact of austerity policies on the labor market.	yes
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	The continued tension between supply and demand in the US labor market will be the underbelly of the US economy in 2023.	yes
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	With the end of the stack of interest rate increases and repeated inflationary forecasts, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.	no
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Until this release, the U.S. equity and debt markets were overly optimistic about the Fed's path to hikes.	no
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	As the inflation numbers continue to improve, the Fed continues to maintain the delicate balance of market inflation expectations while reducing its rate hikes, but the market is blind to the Fed's pro-confrontation rhetoric, and is not only expecting an early halt to the rate hike, but also two rate cuts by the end of the year.	no
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	With the labor market tight in supply and demand, and the impact of austerity policy uncertain, we believe the Fed's guidance for interest rate hikes at the end of the year was relatively reasonable, as the market expected extreme adjustments and trading overcrowd may do some damage to the market.	no
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	However, the persistence of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapidly declining inflation, as the M2 data overlaps, and the leading indicators of the various CPI components have gradually turned. The US CPI data has been shifted to a phase of rapid decline since October, the persistence of wage growth is only a support for future inflation data, and the current market expectations are not easy to falsify, after the release of the next inflation data or enter a new round of play.	no
杉杉创始人郑永刚因突发心脏疾病过世 曾带领中国服装第一股转型 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	The founder of Sugizu, Yang Yonggang died of a sudden heart attack after leading the first transformation of Chinese clothing. - Economic Observer	yes
经济观察网 记者 郑淯心 2月11日，认证主体为杉杉控股有限公司（以下简称“杉杉控股 ” ） 的微信公众号发布讣告，杉杉企业创始人、杉杉控股董事局主席郑永刚因突发心脏疾病救治无效，于2023年2月10日去世，享年65岁。	WeChat public notice issued by the certified entity WeChat Holding Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the "Suguj Holding Company") issued on February 11, the founder of Suguj, the chairman of the board of Suguj, died on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65 due to sudden cardiac illness and ineffective treatment.	yes
上世纪80年代，郑永刚担任国营棉纺厂的厂长，随着调任，1989年郑永刚成为杉杉股份的前身宁波云港服装总厂的厂长。	In the 1980s, Zeng was the head of the state-owned cotton and silk mill, which he later turned over. In 1989, Zeng became the head of the Ningbo Yunsheng Clothing Factory, the predecessor of Shuiji Shares.	yes
2022年12月，在第二十届中国企业领袖年会暨第二十二届中国企业未来之星年会上，郑永刚在演讲中称，在上世纪90年代的中国西服市场，杉杉品牌的市占率曾高达37 % 。	In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd China Business Future Yearly Celebrations, Yang Yumangang said that in the 1990s, the market share of the Suzhou brand in the Chinese western market was as high as 37%.	yes
1996年杉杉股份（600884.SH）上市，成为中国服装业第一家上市公司。	In 1996, SONGZONG SHARES ((600884.SH) went public, the first listed company in the Chinese garment industry.	yes
就在服装业务如日中天时，杉杉集团却开始转型，因为郑永刚意识到 ， “ 一旦市场放开，中国品牌自然会形成一个梯队式品牌市场，杉杉西服想一直独领风骚，长期成为国人的国服的可能性不大 ” 。	Just when the clothing business was in full swing, the Susuk Group began to transform, as Wu Yeonggang realized that once the market opened, Chinese brands would naturally form a tiered brand market, and that Susuk's clothes would remain in the spotlight and unlikely to become the country's national clothing for a long time.	yes
1999年，杉杉开始研究企业转型，郑永刚回忆当年 ， “ 我们来到上海，寻求到底转型做什么，专门找了很多专家学者，连续不断地开一些诸葛亮会、务虚研讨会。	In 1999, Sugi began researching enterprise transformation, and Zhong Yonggang recalled the year, "We came to Shanghai to find out what transformation really does, we found a lot of specialist academics, and we held various debates, workshops and seminars".	yes
最后，我们设定了两个大的战略方向。	Finally, we set two major strategic directions:	yes
第一个方向是新能源新材料，另外一个是大健康有未来 ” 。	The first is the use of new energy and new materials, and the other is the future of great health.	yes
战略方向确定后，杉杉开始寻找合作，那时候鞍山热能院为鞍钢配套的炭素研究所在做国家863课题，科研经费不够，于是杉杉和鞍山热能院碳素研究所签署合作协议，共同推动国家863课题“中间相炭微球”项目产业化，从事负极材料的研发、生产和销售，在国内实现负极材料的商用推广。	After the strategic direction was determined, Suzuki started to look for cooperation. At that time, the Busan Institute of Thermal Energy's Carbon Institute was doing the national 863 project for aluminum, and the research funding was not enough. Suzuki and Suzuki signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 phosphates microcarbon spherical projects in the field of nitrogen and magnesium, and engaged in the research, production, and sales of negative polar materials, and the commercial promotion of negative polar materials in the country.	yes
2001年，杉杉股份实现中间相炭微球的规模化生产，开始国产化替代，取代日本成为国内中间相炭微球主要供应商。	In 2001, the company achieved large scale production of intermediate-phase carbon nanoparticles, began domestic substitution, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate-phase carbon nanoparticles in the country.	no
这是中国第一家锂离子电池负极材料生产企业，实现了锂离子电池负极材料国产化。	This is the first lithium-ion battery negative materials production company in China, achieving the indigenisation of lithium-ion battery negative materials.	no
随着锂电池的应用迅速普及，杉杉股份的锂电池业务开始逐步发展，2007年锂电材料业务被写入了杉杉股份的主营业务，服装业务营收占比逐年减少，直至2013年，杉杉股份的锂电材料业务收入全面超过服装业务。	With the rapid popularization of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Sugihiro began to develop gradually. In 2007, the lithium electrochemical materials business was written into the main business of Sugihiro stock, and the revenue share of the clothing business declined year by year, until 2013, the revenue of the lithium electrical materials business of Sugihiro stock completely exceeded the clothing business.	no
2021年2月，杉杉股份成功并购LG化学偏光片业务，进军LCD偏光片市场，并成立偏光片企业杉金光电，该领域技术含量比较高，杉杉的主要的竞争对手都是世界500强，如韩国三星、日本的住友化学、日东电工。	In February 2021, Sugihisa Securities successfully merged with the LG Chemical polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and founded the polarizer company Sugihisa, a technology field with relatively high technical content. Sugihisa's main competitors are the top 500 companies in the world, such as Samsung of Korea, Sumitomo Chemical of Japan, and JD Electric.	no
郑永刚曾分享过投后管理的心得 ， “ 中国的民营企业收购国际上的一些高科技企业，成功概率比较低，为什么那些收购会失败？	Liu Yungang shared some of his experiences with post-investment management, and why private Chinese companies that have been taking over some of the world's top high-tech companies have such a low probability of success.	no
因为大家都会去考虑，我花了那么多钱，我得去派人管对吧，这是通常会做的一个行为 ” ， 然而郑永刚则不同，杉杉收购成功的那一天，郑永刚就到杉金光电当众宣布，杉杉作为杉金的大股东，决定实施一企两制，除了郑永刚担任董事长，杉杉企业的人不派到杉金，采取授权经营的方式，原有的分配制度、企业文化、各项管理等模式不变。	Because people think that I spent so much money, I have to send people to deal with it, this is the usual behavior. However, the day of the successful acquisition of Sagami, Song Yongkang is different, Song Yongkang goes to Sagami Kingu Electric public announcement, Sugami as a major shareholder in Sagami Kingu, decided to implement a two-way system, except for Song Yongkang as chairman, the people of Sagami Kingu do not send to Sagami, taking the authorized way of operating, the original distribution system, corporate culture, management, etc.	no

近期与大陆学界视讯座谈，以及这次的座谈，没有听到涉台学者讲武统与“反分裂法”，取而代之的是恢复交流与对话。	Recent video conferences with mainland scholars, and this one, did not hear the Taiwanese scholars talk about unification and de-escalation, but instead about restoring communication and dialogue.	yes

阿拉斯加上空被击落的 “物体”究竟是什么？	What was the plutonium that was dropped over Alaska?	yes
扑朔迷离，猜测纷纷	who are deluded, doubters.	yes
美国军方周五（2月10日）下午再次动用美国最先进的隐身喷气战机F-22击落了一个在美国阿拉斯加上空飞行的尚未确定身份的物体。	The U.S. military used its most advanced stealth fighter, the F-22, again on Friday afternoon to shoot down an unidentified object flying above Alaska.	yes
击落的地点距离阿拉斯加海岸十英里。	The site of the crash was 10 miles off the coast of Alaska.	yes
这是美军在不到一周的时间里第二次击落空中飞行物体。	This is the second time the US military shot down a flying object in less than a week.	yes
上周六，来自中国的一个间谍气球在美国领空上漂移数日后在美国南卡罗莱纳州沿岸附近上空被击毁。	On Saturday, a spy balloon from China was shot down off the coast of South Carolina, days after it drifted into US airspace.	yes
五角大楼说，第二个被击落的物体于周四晚上首次进入美国领空，在阿拉斯加东北部上空移动时被美国军方跟踪，飞行高度为1.2万米（4万英尺），其大小与一辆小型汽车差不多，与先前被击落的那个中国间谍气球相比要小很多。	The second object, the Pentagon said, first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday evening, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeast Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), the size of a small car, and much smaller than the previously downed Chinese hydrogen balloon.	yes
五角大楼还认为，目前没有迹象显示，这个物体是可操纵的。	The Pentagon also believes there is no indication that the object is manoeuvrable.	yes
白宫国家安全委员会战略沟通协调员约翰·科比周五表示，虽然这个在高空飞行的物体的具体样子尚不清楚，但它“对民航飞机的安全构成了合理的威胁”。	John Cobb, the White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator, said Friday that while the shape of the high-altitude object is not yet clear, it posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian airplanes.	yes
科比表示，这个物体与美国境内发现的那个间谍气球不同，它上面没有悬挂“有效载荷”。	Corby says that the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, is not equipped with a hanging cargo pod.	yes
科比说，“我们把它称为一个‘物体’是我们目前能够作出的最好的描述”。	Corby says that we call it a "rogue object", which is the best description we can come up with.	no
拜登总统在下令击落这个物体之前听取了五角大楼的建议，他作出这个决定的时候“非常谨慎”，科比补充说。	President Biden consulted the Pentagon before ordering the shooting down, and he was very careful in his decision, Coby added.	no
美国官方对这个物体的描述大致可以归纳为：大小相当于一辆小汽车，没有操纵杆，没有悬挂装置，飞行高度为一万米左右。	The US official description of the object could be summarized as "about the size of a small car, with no rudder, no suspension, and a flight altitude of about 10,000 meters".	no
但这些信息还无法回答基本问题，比如这个物体究竟是什么东西，它属于哪个国家，它在执行什么任务。	The information does not address basic questions such as what the object is, what country it belongs to, and what its purpose is.	no
目前网上许多的分析和猜测认为，这可能又是一只中国气球。	Many of the analysts and speculations online suggest that it could be another Chinese balloon.	no
它可能与入侵美国领空的那只间谍气球和在拉美上空飘动的那只中国气球一样都来自中国，它们在不同地点执行某种任务。	It could have come from China like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon which flicked over Latin America, but they were doing some kind of mission in different places.	no
也有人把阿拉斯加的这个“物体”与“不明飞行物”（UFO）联系在一起。	The mysterious object in Alaska has been linked to the sighting of UFOs.	no
美国新闻周刊的报道引用美国前众议员彼得·梅杰（Peter Meijer）周五在推特上发出的推文说，“真希望这个‘不明飞行物’也是一个间谍气球，而不是一个合法的UFO”。	U.S. Newsweek, citing tweets from former U.S. Representative Peter Meijer on Friday, tweeted that he hopes that the UFO was a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO.	no
“将外星飞船与气象气球混为一谈的讽刺意味很令人惊讶，但这不值得引发一场星际冲突，”梅杰说。	The irony of confusing alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it's not enough to provoke an interstellar conflict, said Mayer.	no
梅杰是在科比证实阿拉斯加的这个物体被击落之后不久发出这个推文的。	Megger's tweet came shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object had been shot down in Alaska.	no
新闻周刊说，怀疑这个物体是UFO的不止是梅杰一人。	Newsweek has written that more than one person suspected that the object was a UFO.	no
田纳西共和党籍众议员蒂姆·伯切特（Tim Burchett）批评政府上个月的掩盖情报的做法，要求国家情报总监办公室 (DNI)公布有关“不明飞行物”的报告。	Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett criticized the administration's cover-up last month and called for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on missing UFOs.	no
亚马逊的客服态度让我难以相信	Amazon's customer service is hard to believe	yes
估计很少有人看到这里，但是我也要稍微说一下。	It's estimated that very few people have seen it, but I will also tell you something.	yes
这件衣服当时我们购买的时候是一件拉链帽衫，最后送给我确是一件短袖。	When we bought the dress, it was a hooded shirt, but at the end I was given a pair of shorts.	yes
收到衣服后立即与亚马逊客服取得了联系，当时确认衣服还是有库存的，我要求换货，客服说去解决一下，然后立即看到商品名称变成了短袖，原来我买的链接下架。	After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted the customer service of Amazon, who confirmed that the clothes were still in stock, I asked for a replacement, the customer said to resolve this, and then immediately saw the item names turned into shorts, the link that I bought was off the shelf.	yes
接着客服通知要么保留货品补偿一定金额，要么退货。	The customer service can either retain the merchandise for a certain amount, or return the item.	yes
这就是亚马逊的处理方式？	This is how Amazon does it?	yes
真的很难以置信，本身衣物发错并不是我的问题，作为一个消费者我要求获得我应获得的商品，并没有提出什么很夸张的要求，亚马逊却改名字，说无库存。	It is hard to believe that the clothing itself is not my problem and, as a consumer, I ask for what I deserve, without making any extravagant demands, and Amazon has changed its name, saying there's no stock.	yes
这是我的第一个长评，希望这不是我的最后一个。	This is my first long post, and hopefully not my last.	yes
让人无法理解的袖子	The Unfathomable Sleeve	yes
说是牛皮的，也确实比较硬，但仔细看的话，局部有很多细小的裂痕，搞不清楚是否是真皮的，另外这个衣服的袖子真是让人无法理解，通常夹克的袖子要比衣摆长一些，不过通常也就1-2厘米，这件衣服足足长了5厘米，手臂自然下垂应该在手掌虎口的位置，但这件衣服的袖子都盖过手指了。	The coated fabric is quite hard but if you look closely, there are many cracks that it is not clear whether it is leather, and the sleeve of the dress is really hard to understand. The sleeves are usually longer than the jacket, but usually 1-2 cm. The length is about 5 cm, the arms should be in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves are covered by the fingers.	yes
买衣服容易，退货也容易。	It's easy to buy clothes, and easy to return them.	yes
但是要退还钱真不知何时？	But when will the money be back?	yes
衣服做工不错，因为版型偏小，只得退货，但是退了货以后，至今一个多星期过去了，还没有收到退款？	The clothes are nice to have, since the prints are small, they have to be returned, but it's been more than a week since the return but I haven't received the refund yet!	yes
而且要购买者自已和那个诚信度不怎么样的全峰快递联系，这是自购亚马逊的物品以来最糟糕的一次购物！	And for customers to make a purchase on their own, contacting an untrustworthy Pinnacle Express company, is the worst thing that they've ever done since buying from Amazon!	yes
但店家还是不错的，积极配合催促快递及时退款，但是这个全峰快递实在的工作是做的相当让人愤怒，拖拉半个月左右才退款，这种合作伙伴是要拖亚马逊的后腿的，工作效率差，没有服务意识！	It's just that the store is good, they actively help in making the returns on time, but the real work done by the express service at Peak Express is quite irritating, it takes about half a month to make a return, and this partnership is to drag the back legs of Amazon, low work efficiency, no service awareness!	yes
更适合年轻人	More for young people	yes
99秒杀的。	99 seconds to kill.	yes
毛裤的做工、颜色、手感都不错，柔软/薄厚适中，没有煤油味儿。	The workmanship, colour and feel are very good, soft/thin to medium thickness, no smell of petrol.	yes
遗憾的是版型属于瘦型的，更适合年轻人。	Unfortunately, the version is thin and more suitable for young people.	yes
3XL，平铺腰围2尺5，拉伸最大尺寸4尺，1.79/80公斤穿着腰有点紧。	3XL, flat waist 2 ft 5, maximum size 4 ft, 1.79 / 80 kg wearing a slight tight waist.	yes
似乎腰间没有松紧带，想加松点腰围还挺困难。	It seems that there is no loose belt at the waist, which makes it difficult to loosen the waist.	yes
另外，贴身穿是不舒服的。	Plus, it is uncomfortable to wear the mask.	yes
很好 颜色不是很鲜艳	Very good. It's not very bright.	yes
刚买就涨了两百多，这是什么情况。	I bought it, I made over two hundred, so what's going on?	yes
第一次亚马逊用的合作的天天烂快递，第一次送货没在家，后来主动和快递员约了两次送货时间，那个快递员都不送，后来直接给我退货了，这个该死的快递员一点诚信也没有，强烈建议不要再用那个天天烂快递了。	First time that Amazon cooperates with the daily courier, the first delivery was not at home, later we made an appointment for two deliveries, the courier didn't deliver, and then returned the order directly to me, this fucking courier didn't have any integrity, and strongly recommended not to use the daily courier again	yes
这一次还有一件体恤衫也给我退货了，再拍也涨价了一百多元。	This time, a shirt returned to me, and the price went up by over a hundred dollars.	yes
亚马逊自营不应该出现这样商品	Amazon should not have this kind of product.	yes
产品特价的时候购买，价格不低，看评论也是很不错的产品。	This is a nice product to buy at a special price, it is not cheap, it was very nice to see the reviews.	yes
实际收到产品的时候让我目瞪口呆，商品表面大面积磨损，多处其他地方都有磨损，不是次品就是旧品，稍后上图。	When I actually received the product, I was stunned by the large area of wear on the surface of the product, there was wear in several other places, and not the secondary product was the old product, as will be shown later on.	yes
我申请退货，厂家的人看到图片后说是运输导致，这不是瞎说吗？	So I asked for a refund, the manufacturer saw my picture and said it was because of the shipping, isn't that bullshit?	yes
商品内部怎么可能磨损？	How can the inside of a product be worn?	yes
只有两种可能，要么次品旧品，要么就是我故意损坏商品，然后拿去退货。	There are only two possibilities, either I had used the product, or I deliberately damaged the product and returned it.	yes
客观来讲，我没有证据证明我没有损坏商品，但是以我在亚马逊购物的信用记录来讲，我认为这样的商品不应该出现在亚马逊自营商品中，客户选择亚马逊自营就是信任，customer win，we win，客户的胜利就是厂商的胜利，希望大家一起努力改进，谢谢。	Objectively, I have no evidence that I didn't damage goods, but based on my credit record of Amazon purchases, I think that such goods should not appear in Amazon self-service products, the customer choosing Amazon self-service is trust, customer win, we win, the customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory, hope you will work together to improve, thank you.	yes
我使用该产品不到一年，就出现两个E2，我不知道如何处理?	I use the product for less than a year, and there's two E2s, and I don't know how to do it?	yes
我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?	I bought the product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two sets at the right of the receiver often appear red E2, it should be a problem with the launch module, which does not quite match the 7 years of sustainable operation of the launch module mentioned on the Amazon site, I am not able to find it on the Amazon website after it was sold, now I don't know how good it is?	yes
还行吧	Let's keep going.	yes
第一次购买是坏的。	The first purchase is bad.	yes
感觉不像新的。	It doesn't feel like new.	yes
盒子上的标签被撕了，机身上标签也破了。	The label on the box was torn, and the label on the machine was broken.	yes
而且老是白屏。	And always blank.	yes
换了以后好了。	We will change it later.	yes
换货挺迅速，晚上有点模糊，视角不是很广，但是普通家用够了。	The transfer was quick, the view was a little hazy at night, not very wide, but it was enough for the average household.	yes
不足就是没有卡，自己买的，还有就是以前在亚马逊买过手机。	I don't think it's enough to have a card, to buy it myself, and to have bought a mobile phone on Amazon.	yes
包装上会有贴纸，防止包装被打开，这次没有，买手机时候还有个贴纸一样的章，可以贴在保修卡上，这次没有。	A sticker would be on the package, to prevent the package from being opened, this time not, and when buying a mobile phone, there would be the same sticker section which could be on the warranty card, this time not.	yes
不知道是不是东西便宜了就没有，很困惑。	I don't know if it was cheap or not, I'm confused.	yes
等待供货商回复	Waiting for a response from the supplier	yes
包装没有任何标识，直接给供货商致电说，回答没标识是正品，如怀疑可用边角料邮寄到强生公司验货，还留下车牌号以及电话号码，承诺会发短信通知把我的信息输入强生官网保修卡，到现在也没收到短信啊？	It didn't have any markings, I called the supplier directly and the answer was without markings, as suspected but can use the borders to post it to the JSON company to verify the goods, and also leave the license plate number and phone number, promise to send a text message to inform me to enter my information in the JSON official website warranty card, so far no texts are received?	yes

支持星冠，支持胜牌，对车有效保护。	Support the stars, support the winning cards, protect the car.	yes
日本亚马逊因为客服问题导致买家的利益严重受损（8c的毛毛虫发货为8cm的毛毛虫）（8c=14cm，8cm=2c）	Japanese Amazon suffered big buyer losses due to customer service issues ((8c worm delivery at 8cm worm)) ((8c = 14cm, 8cm = 2c))	yes
承认错误，但是一直在推诿，始终强调货物为第三方，不能约束第三方。	Admitted to error, but I am always recommending and always emphasizing that the goods are third party and not binding on third parties.	yes
订单编号：503-4265464-1830254。	The order number is 503-4265464-1830254.	yes
我当初购买的页面尺码选项为7c，8，9c，当时觉得这就是个陷阱，打电话给日亚中文客服，明确告知8就是8c，但是等商品回到中国才发现，只有8cm，我觉得这完全是故意设下的陷阱来坑中国人（按照亚马逊的售后），现在查看页面已没有这个选项。	I initially bought the page size options for 7c, 8, 9c and at that time thought it was a trap, so I called the Japanese Chinese customer service and clearly told them the 8 was 8c, but when the same goods returned to China I discovered only 8 cm, I thought this was a trap set to trap the Chinese (according to the Amazon sale), and now the page has no this option.	yes
中方客服：很抱歉，给你带来损失了，我们给你两条路走：	The Chinese service: We are sorry for your loss, and we give you two choices:	yes
1，你退货，买家承担所有运费。	1, you return the item and the buyer pays for all shipping costs.	yes
2，你不退货，我们补偿你1000日元。	2, If you don't return it, we will refund you 1000 yen.	yes
（我算一下账，鞋子4000多日元，算作200rmb，选择1，我没有鞋子，损失在200元。	(I did a calculation, the shoes are over 4000 yen, counting as 200 rmb, pick 1, I have no shoes, the loss is 200 yuan ▽)	yes
选择2，我有鞋子，最后补偿了我2000日元，最后损失在150rmb 客服：我们已记录下来，我们会认真处理，次日回了封邮件，说我不接受中方客服调解，就这么完了。	Option 2, I have shoes, I've been paid 2000 yen for them, and I'm losing about 150 rmb. Customers: We have recorded this, we take it seriously, and the next day the mail came back, saying that I do not accept the Chinese customer mediation, and that's it.	yes
我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	I said, the purchase page is about confusing options like 7c, 8, and 9c, and the Chinese customer service assistant said the Japanese code would not have a c like that, like 140, but have you seen other caterpillar pages?	yes
都有美码，日码混标的情况出现。	However, the Japanese language is also a very strong and popular language among the younger generations.	no
再说，你8cm为什么放在7c和9c中间，明明最小的尺码，你放那里算什么意思。	Also, why did you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, the smallest size, and what does that mean?	no
中方客服：我们提供中文服务，但是不知道你要运回国，所以你的运费我们是不予理赔的。	Chinese service: We provide services in Chinese, but we did not know you were returning your item, so we do not reimburse you for the cost.	no
这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	That logic I don't understand, I am Japanese, I still want to use Chinese suits, the Chinese living in Japan don't need Chinese suits, go to Japan as a tourist without that kung fu to make international long-distance, and the question arises, why should one need to go to Amazon to buy Chinese phones abroad, just like the one I'm picking every day.	no
亚马逊中文客服不就是方便了我们海淘的这些人吗？	Did Amazon's Chinese language customer service make it easier for those who went out of business?	no
这次购买不是很满意	Not very happy with this purchase.	yes
这是第二次从亚马逊上购买帮宝适尿布，曾经在宝宝2个月的时候买过一箱，选择了欧洲进口纸张的尿布，第一次购买经历还是比较满意的，宝宝整夜就用一张尿布，的确可以满足12个小时不换尿布。	This is the second time that I bought baby diapers from Amazon, I bought a box once when baby was 2 months old, I chose the diaper from European imported paper, my first time was a good experience, the baby is using a diaper all night, and indeed we could use a baby nap for 12 hours without changing diapers.	yes
但是这次购买L号的尿布，一箱里面有2包分开包装，打开后就觉得纸张比较松，跟进口帮宝适有明显区别，给宝宝用了之后，还算可以，没有漏尿也没有红疹等迹象。	But this time I bought L diaper, there are 2 packages in a box, after opening it feels that the paper is loose, there is a distinct difference between importing and serving the baby, and after using it, it is good enough, there is no leaking urine and there are no signs of redness.	yes
但是到了第二包尿布，开始使用后宝宝的大腿内侧立马就出现了红疹，至今还没有褪去。	But after the second pack of diapers, and immediately thereafter, a rash appeared on the inside of the child's thigh and has not yet gone away.	yes
怀疑1箱里面的2包，质量还不一样啊。	I suspect 2 packs in the same pack of the same quality.	yes
以后应该不会继续购买了！	I don't think we should keep buying it!	yes
希望重视包裹的运输保护	We want to protect the transport of parcels.	yes
这是我网购这么久以来，看到最差的一次包装运输，完全没有什么保护措施，缓冲泡沫，包裹缓冲层材料等，什么都没有。	This is the worst package I have ever seen in a long time, with no protection whatsoever, no buffering bubble, no packaging buffers, and nothing at all.	yes
就一个压变形的箱子。	It is a deformed box.	yes
而且里面的软胶盒包装的，卡盒都压开了压到变形了。	And the cartons were wrapped in plastic box, and the cartons were all pressed and deformed.	yes
希望是正品 质量有保证，以后是不怎么敢亚马孙买东西的了。	Hope it's authentic and quality is guaranteed, so don't be afraid to buy something from Amazon.	yes
宁愿国内贵一半，有保障点。	It is better to pay half the price in India with some kind of security.	yes
而且商品产品包装问题，我看评论2016年就有人评论过，到现在19年，还是老样子。	And the packaging of products, as I read on this blog, was discussed in 2016, 19 years ago, and it's still the same.	yes
说明亚马逊根本就不重视服务反馈这一块，和国内的京东、天猫等差太远了。	This shows that Amazon doesn't care about the feedback at all, and is far from Japan's JD.com and TCL.	yes
好看，但有点点小遗憾	Nice, but a little bit sad	yes

比我想象的小一些，不过本来就是拿来带出门用的，所以还可以接受。	I think it is smaller than I thought, but it is meant to be used for carrying out of the house, so it's acceptable.	yes
昨晚拿回家试了一下，瓶盖推开之后，吸管和盖子之间的距离太近了，因为吸管的位置是正向垂直的，所以儿子总是要把盖子上面的凸起含住喝水，觉得这个地方是否可以改进一下。	I took it home last night and tried it, after the bottle cap was pushed back the distance between the straw and the cover was too close, the straw was in the vertical position, so the son always had to pull on the bulge on the top of the cap with the drink water in it to see if the spot could be improved.	yes
看来其他牌子的吸管杯把吸管做的倾斜还是有道理的，小孩子的东西，真的就是在乎安全和舒适。	It seems like the leaning of the straws on the other brands of straw cups makes sense, a thing of the children, really care about safety and comfort.	yes
轻便大容量	Lightweight and large	yes
喜欢它轻便，开口大，就是两个独立的分隔袋对我来说有点多余，感觉不知道装什么好。	I like it lightweight and large, that's two separate compartments, that's a bit redundant for me, and I don't know what to put in.	yes
买完发现海外购美亚上还有一只另一个牌子很类似的，才不到两百块。	After buying this, he found that there was a similar brand in the US, less than two hundred dollars.	yes
假货，假的特别厉害	Fake, especially the fake ones	yes

假货？	The fake?	yes
总之悲剧。	This is a tragedy.	yes
用第二片的时候选的毛孔细致的，但是一打开就一股怪味，以为是正常的，因为没用过这款，然后往脸上贴的时候就整个受不了了，非常冲的味道，无法形容，熏到立马咳嗽了出来，眼睛也很痛，流眼泪，马上摘了去洗脸。	The hair was selected in a careful way with the second piece, but when opened it had a strange smell, thought it was normal, because I had not used this one, then I could not stand it when I applied it to my face, a very rushed odor, impossible to describe, immediately coughed out, my eyes hurt, tears came down, and I immediately took it off to wash my face.	yes

用后感受	The aftertaste	yes
第一次在亚马逊买东西，分别感受有几点，先来说下用完商品的感受吧，第一确实是无痛，也没有刺激味道的东西，总体来说很不错的，静等8分钟左右一擦就掉了，只是会有少量的汗毛渣在上面，不细看是看不出来的，所以说总体是不错的，至于之后都就用一次还要继续观察，继续用才会知道。	The first time I buy anything on Amazon, I felt a few things, firstly, I use up the product, the first is really painless, no stimulant taste, in general, it is very good, quietly wait about 8 minutes, it will just fall, just a small amount of sweat and hair on it, you can't see it, so it's generally good, and after it, it should be used again and continue to observe, continue to use it only to know.	yes

第三，亚马逊的什么黑色星期五就不要相信了，星期五下单，等了2天就便宜了接近12块钱，也就是我买成170多（加上运费什么的），有一种搞活动就提价格的感觉样。	Third, don't trust Amazon's Black Friday, order on Friday, it was cheaper for nearly $12 after waiting for 2 days, I made more than 170 (and shipping costs), so there's an event to raise the price.	yes
客服说什么价格波动，我关注了10多天价格也就是这个样，波动也不大的。	I had been looking at the price for more than 10 days, and it's been like that, no big fluctuations.	yes
价格实惠，日原产，有中文标签，带颗粒，绝对回购！	Affordable, Japanese made, with Chinese labels, with pellets, absolutely bought back!	yes
膏体里带颗粒的，清爽感恰到好处，用后牙齿爽滑，上比某二手东强太多啦，那里说是进口的东西，可好多东西没有中文标签，不知从哪里批发的。	The cream with granules, the freshness is just right, the back teeth smooth, more powerful than some secondhand Oriental, where they say it is imported, but many items are not labeled in Chinese, I do not know where they are being sold in bulk.	yes
以后只要亚马逊有的，绝不再去二手东。	So, as long as Amazon has this product, it will never be a second-hand item.	yes
给个建议，亚马逊的app 上晒单怎么有时晒不了，希望能改进一些应用，会做的越来越好的！	And, I'd like to give some tips, especially the ones that are not written in the Amazon app, but hopefully these things will be improved, and will do better and better!	yes

不会再在卓越上花一毛钱。	No more spending money on excellence.	no
图片质量实在不能接受	The picture quality is unacceptable.	yes
作为“古地图集”这样的标题，本书在图片的选择、排版、印刷上实在令人难以接受，有些图片甚至有马赛克，模糊到无法辨识。	As a title of the anthology, the book is difficult to accept in terms of the selection, printing and printing of the images, some of them are so obscure with mosaic that they are not recognizable.	yes
即便本书不是专业的地图册，即便是小画幅插图，也应该对得起目录中祖先留下来的洋洋大观的中古文献资料！	Even if this is not a professional map, even if it is a small illustration, it should be the source of the vast, medieval documents left by our ancestors!	yes
（况且很多图片是可以从相关行业资源中获取清晰的原始文件的），用这样的图片来拼凑图书与不使用图片有何差别？	What is the difference between using these images to compose a book and not using them (and many of the pictures are clear, raw files from related industry resources)?	yes

文字方面不予评价，方家各有分辨。	The text is not judged, but it is the choice of the family.	yes
整体2星。	Overall 2 stars	yes
高二的时候看的这本书当时只是抱着无聊看看玩的心态，感觉这样的书自己应该不会沉迷吧，毕竟起点的网文以往还是不太吸引我的。	The book I read in high school was just a bored-looking book, and I felt that I shouldn't be addicted to it, and after all, the original web content wasn't as attractive to me.	yes
然后...就掉坑里了。	And then... I fell into the pit.	yes
按着这个剧情来说，整本书都是比较轻松愉快的，前部分叶修还在网游里的时候，即使是公会之间勾心斗角，也因为往往被叶神狗血，搞得一点也不沉重。	According to this story, the whole book is a more relaxed and enjoyable, the first part of the book, while still in the Internet, was not at all difficult, even when the war between the two communists was fought, because often he was killed by a dog named "Yeshan".	yes
至于到了比赛的部分，写出了时代的变迁新旧交替的一点点心酸之感（可能是我多愁善感）。	As for the competition, I found something about the change of the times and the alternation of the old and new, but with a bit of bitterness (maybe it's me).	yes
看整部书花了我高二许多学习时间，可是就是停不下来。	The whole book took me a lot of time to learn, but it just didn't stop.	yes
全职对人物和感情线的描写让人十分惊艳，有的人物只是偶尔带过，也会给人留下很深的影响，像比较重点描写的角色叶修黄少天苏沐橙都有大量的粉丝，而不在写作中心的角色例如江波涛楚云秀等等也十分找人喜欢，在一个电竞的爽文中竟然让人找不到一个让人讨厌至极的人物，这是全职在人物描写上的成功。	Full-time portrayal of characters and emotional lines is very surprising, some characters are only occasionally brought, but also will have a profound impact, like the more important character portrayed by Ye Xiao Huang, which has a lot of fans, but the characters not in the writing center, such as Jiang Bo, Chong Jun Hsu, and others are very popular, in an electronic essay to find that no one can find an extremely hateful character, this is a full-time success in character portrayal.	yes
而在感情线上，全职也没有一般网文所令人诟病的后宫佳丽三千万要么美女要么腐的毛病，全文所有人的感情，都有一个共同的地方就是他们喜欢着荣耀这个游戏，并且大都想要堂堂正正的胜利。	And in emotional terms, there's not a single piece of work, and there's no general network, either beautiful or rotten, all of the people's feelings have one thing in common, that they love to glorify the game, and most of them really want to win.	yes

这或许也是为什么全职没有什么令人讨厌的角色。	This is probably why there are no annoying full-time roles.	yes
全职的IP很大，也归功于此。	The full-time IP is quite large, thanks to this.	yes
撇开网文这个文化现象不谈，全职不失为一本不错的书。	And the book, which is not yet out of print, is a cultural phenomenon, but it is a good book.	no
多少他真的会给人提供一些热血，一点点感动。	I think he's going to be able to offer you some warmth, a little bit of emotion".	no
今年4月份全职要动漫化。	An anime will be released in April this year.	no
其实想要买齐这套书很久了，碍于永远钱包不够厚都没狠下心下手，然后想要买的时候就发现，tb上简直是假货猖獗，其实全职最近出了另一个版本，封面图吧我自己是蛮喜欢的，但还是打算先买老的版本，所以就在亚马逊上看了看，一次性买下来了一套。	I've actually wanted to buy this book for a long time, and I don't have the time for my money to buy it, and then when I wanted to buy it, I found that it was a fake, in fact, another version was recently released, and I'm very fond of the cover art, but I was going to buy the old version first, so I looked it up on Amazon, and I bought a set of it.	no
接下来简单说一下货的情况。	The next step is just to talk about the status of the goods.	no
●第四本的塑封没有，但书是新的。	● The fourth book has no plastic cover but the book is new.	no
●第十七本塑封是在但是被打开了，书的质感也很奇怪感觉没有其他的硬。	● The 17th plastic book was but opened and the texture of the book was also strange, there was no other hardness.	no
●第23本和第十七本情况一样，但是也比第十七本硬，但十分的旧。	• The 23rd is the same as the 17th, only harder, but much older than the 17th.	no
●个别几本书的出版社不同好像第23和17就是同一个出版社，和其他的不同。	● The publishers of each of the books are different, as if 23 and 17 were the same publisher and different from the other books	no
●整体来讲还算满意，24本很大一箱，很满足。	● Overall, it was satisfactory, 24 is a big box, very satisfactory.	no
落寞的小狮子	The young lion with the cubs	yes
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	When they got the book, they thought it would be as simple as the lost horn of our mother, but it turned out to be a lot of words!	yes
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	The next day, he read the book three times and then he gave the book to the children, a little lion that can shoot, a little lion that likes to eat juice and sugar.	yes
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	To see the lion eating the hunter, it is somewhat uncomfortable, and modern urban people find it a bit unacceptable that an animal should be eaten.	yes
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	Finally, this little lion, who was successful in human society, lost himself; he was no longer a full lion nor a full man.	yes
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	In the end, only the back of the little lion knows where he went.	yes
可能多年以后，这个小狮子的形象还留在长大了的小朋友的印象中，在某一天不经意的时候被想起，或许对她会有触动或是启发。	Perhaps many years later, the image of the little lion will live on in the memory of young children who have grown up and remember it at a later date. It may have touched or inspired her.	yes
性价比很高的作品集	A collection of works with a high price tag	yes
1、以前还不知道TASCHEN，最近买了不少他们的书，原因就是太强悍，不论是选题还是制作本身。	I didn't know about Taschen before and bought a lot of their books recently because they were very hard, both in terms of the subject matter and the production itself.	yes
本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	There have been three previous editions of this work: the largest, like the whole of Michelangelo, is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this is the smallest, with a bookcase and in a two-volume edition.	yes
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	In the first place, the book is inexpensive; it is more than 700 pages, and it is even better in book form to have a double printing; the second is that in contrast to Michelangelo's whole work, in which the painting is the main subject, the Da Vinci manuscript is mostly in black and white, which is best value for money for the non-artistic reader to appreciate both the painting and the manuscript.	yes
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	2. The description of the painting part is great, there are structural analysis, analysis of the drafts and historical background (e.g., Last Supper), but I don't know if it's printing or book size, some shade parts of the county are too deep, not see details, a little unfortunately.	yes
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	And third, the Da Vinci code is much richer than the manuscripts of Michelangelo.	yes
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius, the latter is too ambitious and high in achievement to be described as such.	yes
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	When you see a drawing and only half of a da Vinci, the manuscript has no language at all.	yes
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Trash, who bought who regrets!	yes
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	I never said anything against him, this honest piece of trash, bought a waste of money, a horse, give me a reason!	yes
1.走时不准，突然变成1月1号，时间归零了。	The time is off and all of a sudden it is January 1, and time goes back to zero.	yes

3.经常连不上手机。	3. frequently unable to answer the phone.	yes
4.续航只有五天。	4. The flight lasted only five days.	yes
5.睡眠检测不显示，时间是0。	5. Sleep test does not show, time is 0 ◦	yes
6.不防水。	6. It is waterproof.	yes
7.其他。	7. Other	yes
物流太慢	Logistics are too slow.	yes
显示10月16号到，结果21号才收到，差评！	It's very sad when we see the results of the 16th of October, only on the 21st of October.	yes
快递太差，亚马逊上买东西本来就慢，没想到会这么慢！	The delivery is not very good, shopping on Amazon is slow, I didn't expect it to be so slow!	yes
总体满意	Overall satisfaction	yes
之前一开始还担心相机的包装，这次还好，里面有充气包，相机三码一致，也能在官网注册，快门次数0，其余的就只能等时间检验了 。	In the first place I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time, it's okay, it has an inflation bag, camera 3x is same, and it can be registered on the official website, the shutter speed is 0, the rest can be just wait for time to check.	yes
发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	The delivery speed is quite fast, the delivery guy is here, the valuable items are put in the doorway, go fast, I couldn't open the box in front of him and check it, and there's nothing to say about this.	yes
商家发货前做到了为客户着想:)	The merchants thought for the customer before shipping:)	yes
商家比较负责，专门打电话问所用相机的屏幕尺寸，确实替客户着想了。	A professional of the business is responsible enough to call for the screen size of the camera and actually think for the customer.	yes
发货速度也快。	The delivery is fast.	yes
金刚膜贴上去也挺合适和管用的。	The use of the gold foil is also convenient and practical.	yes
电池充不满	Battery failure	yes
机器确实不错，想问下怎么第一次充电起就充不满啊，充电指示灯一直红色	The machine is really nice, I wonder why the first charge is so full, the charge indicator is red all the time	yes
目前找不到亚马逊官方反馈渠道，所以只能在商品评价里反馈	At present, there is no official Amazon feedback channel available, so you can only find feedback through our product reviews.	yes
1. 在 3 月 29 号，通过预购途径使用 31 元购买了此书，显示 3 月 31 号会推送到设备上，此时亚马逊官网上还无法预览该书（因为还未发布）；	1. purchased the book for RM31 on March 29, showing that it would be shipped to your device on March 31, but it is not available for preview yet on the Amazon website (because it is yet to be released);	yes
2. 3 月 31 号推送到设备上的书，内容是空白，只有敬请期待，而亚马逊上该书电子版降价到了 18 元；	2. The book on your device, launched on March 31, is blank, you just have to wait for it, and Amazon reduced the price of the e-book to US $ 18;	yes
3. 这两天反复尝试将设备上的下载的空白的书进行删除，再次同步，都无法获取到包含实际内容的电子版《商业的本质》，但是看到亚马逊官网已经可以预览该书。	3. For two days repeated attempts to delete the blank book downloaded on the device, and synchronise the file, failed to achieve the essence of the commercial e-book containing the actual content, but the pre-release of the book was found on the Amazon website.	yes
目前我有几点感想	So, I have a few thoughts.	yes
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	1. The price is not the most important thing, the key is now how to replace the blank books on the Kindle with books with real content, instead of downloading them forever.	yes
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	2. books that are pre-ordered should not be bought anymore, as it looks quite complicated to download a blank book after a ticket,	yes
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	(For the job description and the online customer service, see how the Microsoft Store does it.) 3 I hope that Amazon has provided a normal channel for feedback on these issues, and a place to give feedback when e-books are downloaded or used in a questionable manner.	yes
不是很推荐阅读	Not recommended reading	yes
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	Read it a long time ago, just happened to see it by memory, and then it got kind of dark when I read it.	yes
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	More than a collection of short stories, the book is a collection of fragments about love in a lifetime.	yes
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The tone of the book is flat, as plain as white water, the syntax pursued to an extreme, and the plot is quiet and plain as a summer afternoon.	yes
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Each short story is a snapshot of a moment from an ordinary life, without beginning or end.	yes
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	What are we talking about when we talk about love?	yes
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I think the novella, as well as the title, is a kind of acting art, the author wants to convey that love is more than just the parting on stage and the sea of urban legends, not only that the love of me is like paint, love is not only above and should not be represented above, love is also life is bland like water, dull tasteless day after day, there are also the speechlessness of life, the escape from reality, the restlessness of the future.	yes
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	When you read this book, you may think of the couples that are arguing around you, the broken marriage of the people you know and the bad feelings.	yes
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	This is why I don't recommend reading, it's not very tasteful from an aesthetic point of view, neither the writing nor the story, and unless your life is as surprising or as sweet as living in a candy castle, the feel of the book will be strange and boring.	yes
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	And in terms of depth of thought, the daily episodes don't illuminate or expand a person's thoughts or perspective (as opposed to Marx's cholera-ridden love triangle), and the short clips do not explore any issues such as what kind of mistake led to the failure of love?	yes
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	Are these the reasons for the breakdown of the main character's marriage?	no
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	I don't recommend this book, because it doesn't matter if you read it or not.	no
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	The idea is that the author's ideas are expressed through technique and style rather than the story, which is the reason for this poor reading experience.	no
适合粗读,不能细看。	This is a good read, but you can't look at it too closely.	yes
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	The book is very logical, but not rich enough.	yes
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	A lot of the theories were explaining what sales is and why, but weak in terms of how to do it, only pointing out the direction and not the specific approach.	yes
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	Also, the book feels like a puzzle.	yes
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	Examples are both domestic and foreign; there are well-known entrepreneurs and salesmen, and famous and not well-known people.	yes
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	It is not known whether the story was intended as an example, it would be more convincing if some of the cases experienced by the author were cited.	yes
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	The name of the client varies.	yes
标题上还是顾客,正文中就变成客户了。	The title is still "customer", but in the main text the text has changed to "client".	yes
电子书中还出现了错别字、标点符号缺失、编号错误的问题。	There are also problems with misspellings, missing punctuation and incorrect numbering.	yes
总之,这本书作为理论入门是个不错的选择,但对于已经从事销售工作想要提高销售水平的人就不太适用了。	Anyway, this book is a good introduction to the theory, but not very suitable for people already in sales work who are looking to improve their sales.	yes
快速了解互联网金融的导读书	A quick guide to understanding Internet finance	yes
这本书很浅，可以说只是一个入门课，可以帮助大家快速了解互联网金融的全貌，但要深入了解，还是要按图索骥，自己去深挖。	The book is very shallow, just a primer that helps you quickly get an overview of the internet finance, but you have to go deeper or you need to dig deeper yourself.	yes
且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	And, in the early days of the book, Alipay and WeChat hadn't mentioned that they had borrowed a subsidy to cultivate the habit of using the Great War, but the share of third-party payments today was so small that it's not mentioned in the book.	yes
现在好多人外出吃饭都是带个手机就好，商家也因为银行流水太高的原因，弃用银联了。	This is the time when many people go out to eat with their mobile phones, and businesses have abandoned the bank, because the cashflow is too high.	yes
但还是非常感谢作者写出这本入门书，看得出作者起码有多年的金融观察经验，对国内外的金融发展史都十分熟悉，所以才能写成如此通俗易懂的内容。	But still, thank you so much for writing this introductory book, which shows that the author has at least years of experience in financial observation, and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so that he can write this general understanding.	yes

决定一个人工作满意度的第一要素不是薪水高低，而是在工作中是否得到了足够重视和赏识。	The first thing that determines a person's job satisfaction is not whether the salary is high or low, but whether the job is valued and appreciated enough.	yes
根据马斯洛需求层次理论，在人的基本生存需要得到满足后，最迫切的就是心理需要的满足——希望被理解、被肯定、被赏识。	According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, after the basic survival needs are satisfied, the most urgent is the satisfaction of the psychological needs: the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.	yes
确实，对于国人来说，大部分是“爱你在心口难开”，即便是怀有爱、感激与赞赏也是默默放在心里不会说出来。	For many of our countrymen, it is difficult to express that they love you, even with love, gratitude and appreciation, but they do not express it silently.	yes
作者在本书中阐述了五种赞赏的语言：肯定的言辞、精心时刻、服务的行为、称心的礼物、身体接触。	In the book, the author articulates the five languages of appreciation: positive words, thoughtful moments, acts of service, appreciative gifts, and physical touch.	yes
我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	I think the important thing is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use them whenever and wherever, to appreciate, to thank and thank those around you, whether family, friends or colleagues.	yes
其实越是亲密的人越需要赞赏和感恩，这样我们的生活才会变得更加美好。	In fact, the more we need appreciation and gratitude from people who are close to us, the better our lives will become.	yes
学会赞赏，企业也能在一定程度上挽留住人才，降低辞职率。	They learn to appreciate, and to some extent they can retain talent and reduce the number of dismissals.	yes
感谢译者给我们带来了精彩的国外的思想和世界。	Thank you translators for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and worlds.	yes
由于中西方文化背景等原因，语言之间或多或少会存在差异，如果有机会能看到作者原版相信会收获更多。	There is more or less a difference between languages due to the cultural background in the Middle and West and more will be harvested, if the chance to see the original text of the author is believed.	yes
再次谢谢作者和译者以及编辑们的辛勤劳动！	Thanks again to the authors, translators and editors for their hard work!	no
疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	Amazon to investigate suspected counterfeit goods	yes
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	quality super poor, packaging loose, no amount, even worse than roadside stalls products, no weight, no bar code, ten bags of packaging is also loose, is completely not a qualified product characteristics; is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, has applied for refund; totally belong to the quality issues; Advise merchants to wipe eyes, reject substandard goods; Add: bought a heart seal, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 volume, added several contrast photos, further confirm the quality of the product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic loss and further dissatisfaction!	yes

马马虎虎的产品，和期望有差距	The product of Ma Ma and Ma Huang has some discrepancy with the expectations	yes
优点：	The advantages:	yes
1. 大品牌，价格便宜。	1. Big brands and cheap prices.	yes
优点2：电机和刀片都是PANASONIC保证的，使用起来也还OK，但是和我期望有差距。	Advantage 2: The motor and blade are Panasonic certified, and are OK to use, but not quite as expected.	yes
缺点：	Disadvantages:	yes
1. 充电没有指示灯，这个最基本你的电源指示都省下了，估计购买300元产品的客户，在松下PANASONIC的眼里，也是施舍，毫无尊重。	Charging without a tell-tale sign, the most basic of your power instructions is omitted, the customer who purchased the estimated 300 yuan product, in the eyes of Panasonic, is also generous, without respect.	yes
2. 有强烈的异味 充电时候，哪怕仅仅充电10分钟，就可以闻到强烈的塑胶燃烧的那种味道。	A very strong smell When charging, even if it is for 10 minutes, you can smell the smell of burning plastic.	yes
办公室试用了1天，搞的全屋子都是这种塑胶味道。	We tried it in the office for a day, and it smelled like plastic all over the house.	yes
和我之前用过的同价位的飞利浦PHILIPS相比，虽然多了个刀头，但是松下这款产品，质量真是对不起消费者了。	This is a bit more expensive than the Philips Philips I used before, but the quality is good and it's a great compliment to the customer.	yes
小包装	Small packages	yes
收到快递一看上面写着电商版就知道又掉坑里了，比超市买的小了好些，应该是M，跟商品介绍上面的图片包装不一样，所谓新版吧。	If I get the express delivery and see the e-commerce version, I will know that it is falling in the hole. It's smaller than the one bought at the supermarket, it should be M, and the packaging is not the same as the picture on the presentation of the merchandise. It's called the new version.	yes
三颗星是怪自己马虎没看清楚商品规格，你卖M码电商版我没意见，你货不对版是几个意思？	3 Stars for the fact that Maharashtra did not read the product specification, and you sold the M-code eCommerce version I have no objection, what do you mean by your version is not correct?	yes
电商套路深，有时间还是去超市买了。	The e-commerce system is deep and there is still time to go to the supermarket to buy it.	yes
就酱紫。	It's about the violet.	yes
味道不喜欢	I don't like the taste.	yes
小孩很不喜欢牙膏的味道，每次都说辣，也许用别的词形容才更贴切，小孩的词库里暂时只有这个词。	Children do not like the smell of toothpaste and say "mop" every time, but maybe there is another term for it, and it is the only word in the children's vocabulary at this point in time.	yes
搞活动时候买的，很便宜，所以也不好意思给差评了，四星吧，不过不会再买了。	I bought it during the events, it is really cheap, so it was a shame to give it a bad rating, 4 stars, but I won't buy it again.	yes
正品哟 包装好	Genuine and packaged.	yes
包装很完整，里面加了充气袋，没有网上评论的只有光秃秃一个产品的样子。	The packaging is complete with a blowable bag, and there are no online reviews as of yet, but the product is still showing.	yes
瓶子外包装上还有一层塑料膜像图片上描述的一样，快递也很快，拍下第二天就来了。	There is also a layer of plastic film on the outside of the bottle as shown in the picture, the delivery is quick, the bottle came the next day.	yes
是正品，只是没货了，不知道什么时候再上架。	This is the original, only it is out of stock and I don't know when it will be available again.	yes
糟心的一次购物体验	One bad shopping experience	yes
黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	The check in the time of black five, the result was not received, after a long time, the parcel was already cleared, asked the colleagues around the saying that there was no help in taking, rush to contact the courier company, but said that the sender could initiate an inquiry, contact Amazon customer service, waiting for more than ten days, finally figure out that the courier was mistakenly delivered to someone else, and then several weeks to finally get back the courier, the outside packaging was unpackaged goods, was intact, and did not know if it had been used, it was bad enough.	yes
错误的配图	The wrong mapping	yes
我以为自己能够收到图1这样的耳机，没想到却收到了图2这样的耳机，图物不一致也就算了，耳机左右声音大小不一又是什么意思？	I thought I could get a headset like Figure 1, but instead I received a headset like Figure 2, even with all the inconsistencies, what is the meaning of the sound varying in size and volume?	yes
虽然名称都是一样的，但还是希望大家能够小心注意，另外还请亚马逊负责人及时更换正确的配图，万分感谢。	Although the names are the same, I hope that you will pay attention, and please have the right layout changed by the person in charge of Amazon in time, thank you very much.	yes
操作系统一般般	Operating systems in general	yes
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	For a while, the overall picture is fine, it doesn't make any difference that the system makes people look tangled, the start time is obviously a little slow, it's not able to do a good setting, and the software is not worth commenting on, the response speed is more general, and it's not that much compared to my colleagues	yes
看评论说很人性化的设计，我没有找到哪里人性化，遥控器这个常用的上下左右，返回键设计的位置实在是不敢恭维。	I didn't find that, since the remote control is used to move things around up and down, and the position of the return buttons in the design is very uncomplimentary 。	yes
所以呢，就当个电视吧，再外加电视盒之类的用吧。	So let it be a TV, then something like a TV box and so on.	yes
降价太厉害了	The price drop is too bad.	yes
降价太厉害了，一百多入现在99！	The price cut is huge, more than a hundred and now 99!	yes
在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	There are a lot of unrated orders on Amazon, so I use one of the clipped sentences as the rating.	yes
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I use this sentence, I would say that the product had at least 85+ points.	yes
而比较差的产品，我绝对不会偷懒到复制粘贴评价，这样其他消费者在购买的时候会作为参考，而商家也会因此改进商品质量。	And if the goods are bad I will definitely not steal to copy and paste the reviews so that other consumers can use it as a reference when buying them so that merchants can improve the quality of the goods.	yes
低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	A very cheap line, that's enough without fever!	yes
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	So cheap line, but it should be the level of the standard of HDMI, personally in contrast to the second kill domestic Autumn leaf originally the motherfuckin joking ((the price is twice as expensive), the line is sturdy, but also soft, 7 meters transmission without noise, low price line approved better!	yes
东西还可以，但是亚马逊的售后服务真的比其他网站差太多了	There's still stuff, but Amazon's after-sales service is so much worse than the other sites.	yes
下单后发现下错了，但是取消订单已经取消不了，网页联系在线客服一直显示错误链接，联系不上。	After placing the order, I discovered an error, but I can't cancel it. The web page has been showing the wrong link, I couldn't be contacted.	yes
到货后送货员给我打电话，我说我不要了，想取消订单的没取消成功，派送员就拿回去了，说先给我签收上，让我申请退货。	When the order arrived, the delivery person called me. I said I didn't want it anymore and wanted to cancel the order, but the delivery person took it back and said he would sign it for me and have me return it.	yes
申请退货时才告知食品类一旦签收不能退货，没办法打电话给亚马逊客服，也是一样说法，签收不能退货。	You can return a product, you can't call the Amazon customer service, the same is true when you say that the food can't be returned if it's checked in.	yes
我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I have bought non-refundable items, including milk, paper diapers and so on, and the customer service gave them back, and the customer service of Jindong was just too big, so the customer service gave it back after opening it.	yes
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	The law is dead, man is alive, how do you deal with your client?	yes
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	I'll either get it myself, or get a courier to buy it for me, it's not easy, why do I give people money to buy things that I don't buy?	yes
行，我也不退了，我自己收下了，但是必须给你们的服务打1分	I'm not retiring, I took it myself, but I have to give you a 1 point for your service	yes
劝大家不要白花钱	We have to make sure that they spend money.	yes
首先满怀期待购买，觉得都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧，收到了以后看包装觉得还可以，个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感，吃到嘴里完全没有味道，寡淡无味，咬开来果肉一圈是暗黄色就是坏了那种，好坏参着卖的，能吃的也就不到三分之一，劝大家不要买，也不便宜，质量太差了！	First full of anticipation to buy, felt that the brand should not be bad, where to go, received in the future to see the packaging felt it was fine, but the head is not good, but a box is basically soft, look is not visible, if you feel it, eat it in mouth without any taste, tasteless, bite the meat a round of dark yellow is bad that sort, badly sold, it can eat less than a third of the price, I advise people not to buy, cheap, the quality is too bad!	yes
吃一堑长一智，以后再也不在电商买水果了！	Eat your heart out and never buy fruit from online stores again!	yes
产品防伪标识在哪里	Where is the anti-counterfeiting logo?	yes
瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的，从外包装袋看，感觉蹂躏的程度让人揪心，毕竟是食物类的包装太简单了，而且还是属于国际购的，还有没看到什么明显的防伪标识标志，开瓶非常轻松，关键是盖内的一层蜂蜜直接从里面冒出来了，有开口几乎是没有什么粘连性，外国产品都是这样的吗？	From the outside of the packaging bag, the degree to which it is hard to feel is disturbing, after all, the food packaging is too simple, and yet belongs to international purchases, and there is no obvious anti-counterfeiting logo, opening the bottle is very easy, the key is that a layer of honey comes directly from the inside, there is an opening that is almost non-sticky, are foreign products like that?	yes
生在中国的我有点不理解了。	I don't get it, I was born in China.	yes
应该是正品吧？	It should be authentic, right?	yes
还有拍下时提示二十几号到，这个是14号收到的，我第一次在这里海外购，只是把自己的疑惑写下来，或许这都是正常的？	There is also the note for the twenties, when this one is received at 14 and this is the first time that I am buying from abroad, and just to write down my doubts, maybe this is normal?	yes
提货服务有待改进	The delivery service needs to be improved	yes
我一共买了5份提货券，在提取时，第一次预约提取3份，结果只寄过来2份，经过多方沟通才确认是漏发、答应后需补发；第二次预约，刚好赶上休息日，网站和微信均无提示需要在工作日预约，造成了不必要的恐慌，建议以后改善。	I bought 5 delivery vouchers in total, when I withdrew, I first requested 3 copies, the first result was only 2 copies, after multiple communication, it was confirmed that it was a missed, I had to make a return; the second booking, just in time for the holiday, website and WeChat had no hint that the booking would be done on a weekday, causing unnecessary panic, I recommend improving later.	yes
不错的购物	Good shopping	yes
东西好评！	Things are good!	yes
还是比较相信亚马逊自营的东西，现在海外购以后很方便，从国外买回来物流时间比国内也就多几天，不得不说亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的，比走转运要快很多，所以现在很多东西都在海外购上买。	It is also convenient to buy things abroad, and the logistics time of buying abroad from abroad to get back and forth from abroad is only a few days longer than in the country. I have to say that the Amazon abroad to get to domestic clearance is still very strong, much faster than to go transport, so many things are now purchased overseas.	yes
希望国内商品的质量和价格能够更好一些，很多东西都是国内产的，但是出去转一圈买回来比在国内还便宜，希望改进。	I hope that the quality and price of our domestic products is a little bit better, many things are produced in this country, but we have to go outside and buy them, it is cheaper than in the country, hoping for improvements.	yes
垃圾	Garbage	yes
看到这样的包裹，试问大家:觉不觉得是路边的垃圾?	If you see a package like this, ask the people: Does it look like trash by the side of the road?	yes
一个塑料易碎的包装，就用一个塑料袋从所谓的德国发过来，这样的包装是负责的吗?	Are we responsible for a plastic package, fragile, that was sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag?	yes
我看这样的包装是装垃圾一样的，购买这个产品，包装及其简陋，没有任何防止破损的措施，就一个简单的塑料袋包装，到手后，包裹完全变形了，里面的物品也有破损。	I look at these kind of packaging as just like junk; I buy this product and packaging with its simplicity without any measures to prevent damage, I pack it in a simple plastic bag, which is then completely deformed, and the items inside are broken as well.	yes
如果我只是碰到一个这样的，我认了，买了几个都是这样子，找亚马逊客服，客服就说可以退，但运费垫付，然后运费以礼品卡的形式返回给我。	If I just bump into one of these, I admit, I buy them all and I go to Amazon, and they say they can be returned, but the shipping cost is paid, and the shipping is returned to me in the form of a gift card.	yes
我试问一下，我用现金支付运费，你们给我返礼品卡，这是要我自己买你们礼品卡就直说啊，还要自己把产品邮寄到德国仓库，这不是买个产品受罪啊!	Let me ask you, I pay the shipping in cash, you give me the gift card, that means I have to buy your gift card myself, let me put it bluntly, or to mail the product to a warehouse in Germany, but it's not a crime to buy a product!	yes
而我一直跟客服说，出现这样的问题是谁的责任，客服却半句不说是他们的责任，连半句责任都不敢担当，这样的售后服务还有什么保障呢? 一句话:认栽!但我估计我这个评价，亚马逊都不会给公布的机会，直接回删除!	And I keep telling my customers about who is responsible for such problems, they don't even say half of their responsibility, not even half of their responsibility, what is the guarantee for this after-sales service? One word: yes!	yes
质量很好5星，物流很差	Good quality, 5 stars, poor logistics	yes
1，质量很好，秒杀的，价格适中，物超所值。	1, very good quality, second hand, moderate price, good value	yes
2，结实、用料足、焊点牢固、表面处理得当、颜色很好。	2, the material is solid, the mould is firm, the surface is well treated, the color is good.	yes
3，物流是硬伤，3号下的单，11号到的。	3, Logistics is hard, the invoice under the 3, the 11 is in.	yes
4，如果亚马逊没有标注预计到货时间是2月7号，我或许会很满意。	4, I might have been pleased if Amazon hadn't marked the expected delivery date as 7 February.	yes
5，但标注了预期到货时间，就相当于给用户一个承诺，当承诺无法兑现的时候，用户很难受。	5, but the expected delivery time is equivalent to giving customers a promise, and when the promise cannot be fulfilled, the customer is very sad.	yes
6，如果你没有给予承诺的把握，请不要做出承诺。	6, If you are not sure, don't make a promise.	yes
7，实际上，我非常在意商家做出的承诺。	7.In fact, I care a lot about the promises made by businessmen	yes
8，所以，我打了低分。	So, I scored low.	yes
金线会掉色	The yellow lines turn.	yes
效果还是有的，但感觉是否明显，就看个人咯，或是心理作用。	The effect is there, but whether the feeling is obvious depends on personal preference, or the psychological effect.	yes
有一点不太好的，就是金色的线，本来设计出来是觉得好看，但实际上，这个金线会掉色，往车上一放，如果拿动几次，手上，和车上，会有一些金粉。	There's something that is not very good, which is the gold wire, which was designed to look nice, but actually, this gold wire will fade and go to the car, if you move it a few times, on your hands, and on the car, there will be some gold powder.	yes
希望产品可以改进。	Hopefully the product can be improved.	yes
这种方形的，也没啥装饰效果，就不要搞金线上去，掉下来在车上弄脏车还麻烦。	This is a square, with no decorative effects, so don't mess up the gold line, fall off and get in the car and mess the car up.	yes
东西完好，速度可以，分2个包裹还不同包装	Things are ready, it's going fast, it's packed in two different packages.	yes
8天的速度蛮快的，但就是2件分了2个包裹，包装还不一样，明显一个防震太多了，厚纸板贴着，封了层塑料，外包装也方便拆，一个就国内的快递盒似的，放了几个缓冲气囊就算事了，感觉有点敷衍。	8 days speed is pretty fast, but 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, packaging is not the same, obviously one is too seismically, thick cardboard is attached, covered with layers of plastic, the outer packaging is easy to remove, one is similar to the domestic express box, put several buffers airbags, the sense of a bit of overlap.	yes
雅兰床垫真心不错	The Yalan Mattress is genuine.	yes
34CM的床垫不是一般的厚，不要床直接睡床垫都可以了。	34 cm mattress is not as thick as usual, but the beds can be used directly.	yes
质量很好，不管是正面还是背面，都挺软的，睡眠很舒服，躺在上面很快就睡着了。	The quality is good, both the front and back are soft, the sleep is very comfortable, and you'll fall asleep very quickly lying on it.	yes
床垫收到后因为快递暴力运输有两处有些污渍，雅兰客服很负责，很有效率的联系解决了问题。	The bedding had a bit of a dirt on it after the delivery because of the messenger's forceful delivery, and the customer service was very responsible and efficient to sort out the issue.	yes
并不是自营商品，亚马逊无耻了	It's not a self-made product, Amazon is shameless.	yes
页面明确标注自营，实际上由供应商配送，售后由供应商负责，出问题自行联系供货商。	The page is clearly indicated as self-serve, the actual delivery is by the supplier, and after the sale is the responsibility of the supplier, if there is a problem, contact the supplier yourself ̳	yes
想取消订单，对不起，订单信息已传递给供应商，不能取消；想退换货，在亚马逊成功申请了退换货，对不起，没有人理你，需要自行联系供货商退货。	You want to cancel your order, sorry, the order information has been passed on to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; want to return the goods, successfully requested the return of the goods on Amazon, sorry, no one has paid attention to you, need to contact the supplier for the return yourself.	yes
这尼玛哪门子自营商品。	This is a niche product.	yes
商品不是亚马逊配送，售后亚马逊不承担，客服竟然说“我帮你联系供应商”，还声称就是自营，太无耻了，赤裸裸的不要脸，赤裸裸的对消费者进行欺诈！	The goods are not distributed by Amazon, after sales Amazon is not responsible, customer service says, "Please help me to contact the supplier, please call us", and claims that they are self-employed, that's too shameless, naked do not show your face, naked to scam consumers!	yes
郁闷的体验	The experience was debilitating.	yes
之前在别家网购的滤芯，过滤效果不错，28天结束之后再用多一两天也一样没有水垢。	The filter works well, after 28 days, one or two days later the water is still free of scale.	yes
由于一直以来在亚马逊购置的东西品质都可以，这次就想着在这边买，第一次在亚马逊买滤芯，感觉不太好，不但早早就开始有水垢，而且滤芯一直用到第28天，都会有悬浮的小黑碳粉，真不知道是继续用下去，还是直接扔了好，非常郁闷~	Since it's always been the quality of what can be purchased on Amazon, this time I wanted to buy here, for the first time in Amazon to buy a filter, it doesn't feel very good, not only the early start to water scale, and the filter has been used until the 28th day, will be floating a small black carbon powder, don't really know whether to continue to use, or to throw out the direct good, very depressed~	yes
没有想象的那么好	It was not as good as I thought.	yes
和我以往用过的插线板比较，外部做工一般，内部如何未拆开看，但愿如店家所描述，从使用方便性上看，每一独立单位是否通电缺少显示	Compared with the plug boards I have used in the past, the exterior is generally working, and the interior is not opened, but as described by the shop owner, from the ease of use, it is possible to see if there is a lack of power supply to each separate unit	yes
包装破损了，等时间来检验产品的质量。	The packaging was damaged, so it's time to check the quality of the product.	yes
外包装破损较严重，里面的包装盒似乎是新的，但是说明书好像不是新的，九月才装修，囤货中，希望到时候不会是坏的，请亚马逊解释一下为什么好几个顾客提到包装破损，你们却能安然处之，谢谢！	It was badly damaged, the box inside looks new, but the instructions aren't new, it was just updated in September, it's still in stock and hopefully it won't be so bad, please explain to Amazon why several customers mentioned damaged packaging and you are safe, thank you!	yes
总体不错，有点小问题	Overall good, with a few issues.	yes
第一次购买滤水壶，看了几篇评价文章，感觉LAICA的性价比高些就选择了这个，收到货按说明书装好了滤芯，试用了一下，感觉总体不错，但是在倒水的时候好像原水会从壶嘴的地方与处理后的水混合（原水仓密封不太严）。	The first time I bought a water filtration pump, I read a few review articles, felt that LAICA is cheaper than the cost, chose this one, received the package according to the instruction sheet, tried it, feeling good overall, but when pouring the water it looks like the original water from the pump nozzle area will mix with the treated water (the original water tank sealing is not too strict).).	yes
用的时候一定要等所有水过滤完再倒出！	When you apply, wait until all the water is filtered and then pour it out.	yes
图片不完整	The picture is incomplete.	yes
图片没有拍出侧面的细节，侧面的细节跟主体的风格并不一致，有很大差别，这是其一；这个珠子是泰国产的，没有标明产地，这是其二；没有标明质地，这是其三；我在英国买的时候，分明每项各有盒子，这里只有一个简简单单的塑料袋，而且珠子上面没有任何的产品标志，我哪里判断得出是真是假。	The picture is not a picture of the side details, the side details are not in line with the style of the subject, there is a big difference, this is the first; this bead is made in Thailand, without indication of origin, this is the second; no mark is the texture, this is the third; when I bought in England, each box was marked, here was just a simple plastic bag, and there is no logo, where I can see is a fake.	yes
购买要慎重哦，尤其是买香港出来的东西。	Be careful what you buy, especially things from Hong Kong.	yes
亚马逊客服真烂	Amazon's customer service is terrible.	yes
两天前下的订单，今天收到就发现降了40块钱，花了好多时间找到客服，客服说没法补差价，可以重买并退货。	Two days ago I ordered and today I see I have lost $40 for the item, it took me a long time to find it, but the customer said that they couldn't make the price, so they will buy it again and return it.	yes

还行，作为新手来说，值得入手	Still, as a newbie, it is worth it.	yes
品相过得去，和极品金刚没得比，之前看过商场那个价格，少说都好几百，我是第一次玩金刚，还行。	I had seen the price in the market before and I have seen that the prices are hundreds, and this is the first time I've played a game of kung fu, and it's okay.	yes

但不得不说的是亚马逊平台之官僚依旧，与几年前我发誓绝对不用的时候没有改进，你永远查不到实际物流状况，信息永远是几个星期以后送到，永远不能投诉，就是这么官僚！	But I have to say that the bureaucracy of Amazon is still the same and is unchanged from what it was a few years ago when I swore it was completely useless and you can never see actual logistics, information is always weeks away, you can never complain, and so on.	yes

有点后悔！	A little bit of regret!	yes
做活动280块买到的，这个价格买到亚瑟士相当划算，当然看评论还有更低的价格。	I bought it for $280, the cost to get it from Arthur was fairly low, and then, of course, I'd read the reviews for a much lower price.	yes
现在说一下鞋子，优点：鞋子很轻，跑步挺舒服，也比较合脚，不会松松垮垮的。	But let's talk about shoes, the advantages: They are light, comfortable to run in, they fit well, they do not loosen.	yes

由于订单是半夜下的，没可能凌晨来收快递，7点多打给客服要求取消订单，客服答复已经取消请等待短信通知。	As the order is made in the middle of the night, it is not possible to receive delivery early in the morning, call the customer service to cancel your order after 7:00 and the customer service response has been canceled. Please wait for SMS notification.	yes
好吧，我就耐心的等着，到了中午上手机一看，订单还在状态还处于未发货，就立马联系客服要求赶快取消订单，客服答复已经操作OK。	OK, I waited patiently, and at noon, I looked at my handset, and the order was still not shipped, so I immediately contacted customer service to cancel it, and they said okay.	yes
到了下午3点上手机一看订单还在，没办法只能再次联系客服明确告知已经第三次来电了，请取消订单并通知卖家务必不要发货！	At 3 pm the order was still there on the mobile, there was no way to contact customer service again and explicitly tell it it was the third time, please cancel the order and inform the seller not to ship!	yes
客服在我要求下当场联系了卖家，并告知我卖家不熟悉系统，要等熟悉系统后再操作取消订单。	At my request, customer service contacted the seller and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and should wait until he became familiar and then cancel the order.	yes
但是明确告诉我卖家已经知道了，绝对不会发货的请放心。	But be sure to tell me that the seller knows about it and that the delivery is absolutely not happening.	yes
等到周一我再看订单显示，竟然已经发货了，我也是无语了。	When I looked at the order again on Monday, it showed it had been shipped and I was speechless.	yes
由于无法直接联系卖家，只能再次致电客服。	As it is not possible to contact the seller directly, you can only call customer service again.	no
后面的处理简直无语，基本都是我说一步，客服才接着操作一下。	The next step was simple: I would say something, and then the customer service would do it.	no
订单到目前为止还是处于派件拒收状态，正准备再次派送！	The order is still in the undelivered status, and is ready to be sent again!	no
亚马逊难道不会主动跟进下吗？	Will Amazon not follow suit?	no
卖家公司反正也收了钱不跟进也无所谓了。	The seller company has received the money anyway and it is pointless not to follow up.	no
总结下以后大件绝对不会预付钱了，这个样子太麻烦了。	In summary, it's no big deal to pay in advance, as if this is too much trouble.	no
看起来很美好	It looks great.	yes
很久以前就看中这个摄像头了，但是因为除了价格外，还有一些别的原因，所以没有购买，这次因为凑包邮，价格也还可以所以就买了。	I noticed this camera a long time ago but I didn't buy it for other reasons besides the price, so I bought it because of the packaging and the price.	yes
买来之后其他的都没什么问题，就是在软件连接的时候，怎么都连不上，我家是TP的路由器，上网查了之后发现好多人都有这个问题，弄了两个多小时，各种改路由器的设置，最后我用360WIFI作为媒介给弄好的，期间给小米客服打电话，他们对这个问题也没有什么解决方法，直接就让我联系亚马逊进行售后。	After buying it I had no problem whatsoever with the other problems, it was not connected during the software connection, my house is TP's router, after searching the web I found out that many people have this problem, and after more than two hours, I changed the settings of the router, and finally I used 360 WIFI as a medium to fix it, during which I called the Xiaomi customer service, they did not have any solution to this problem, and let me contact Amazon directly after sales.	yes
另外一点值得注意的就是我在网上看到用户的评论说，这个摄像头支持的存储卡最小是8G，存储容量更小的就不能识别，希望大家注意这点。	Another point worth noting is that I saw some comments from users online that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, smaller memory capacity is not recognizable, so I would like everyone's attention to this point.	yes
用起来感觉还可以吧，画面还可以接受，但声音音质很差，机器有一定程度的发热，一直开启的话，感觉这种程度的发热有点让人难以接受。	It feels okay, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is poor, the machine has a certain level of heat and it can be hard to accept if you turn it on and on.	yes
综上所述，本产品还有诸多不足，希望大家买的时候要慎重。	All in all, there are many deficiencies of this product, so please be careful when you buy.	yes
之所以给3星，是因为这个是和人生的初恋买的，交往了快3年，就这样于去年离我而去了，一直到现在。	The reason I gave 3 stars was that this was bought with the first love of my life, with whom I was in a relationship for almost 3 years, and then she left me last year, until now.	yes

买这个手机的时候，想想两个当时感觉，还是能一起同甘共苦，但现在却是不堪回首，人生或许就是这样吧，有些人一辈子都不想遇到，有些事儿一辈子都不想知道，可是有什么办法呢？	When I bought this phone, I thought of how it felt then, that you can still share the pain of the same time, but now it's unbearable, and perhaps that's the way life is, some people don't want to meet for the rest of their lives, and some things they don't want to know for the rest of their lives, but what is the solution?	yes
多少次一看到三星这个手机，脑海就想起她，那种痛苦就随之而来灌满全身，我从没舍得用过超过2千元的手机，可是买给她的时候，却毫不犹豫，对一个人再好，可是有天当她变心了，所有的山盟海誓也就烟消云散了。	Every time I see the Samsung phone, I think about her, and that pain fills my body with it. I've never been able to spend over 2 thousand yen on the phone, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate to say goodbye to one person, but one day when she changed her mind, all of her promises vanished.	yes
国产品牌中的精品	The national brand	yes
华为是国货中的精品。	Huawei is a national product.	yes
低调的老总和企业，靠的是技术和质量取胜来赢得客户，这跟当下靠广告运作来提高知名度的营商风气截然不同！	Low-key bosses and enterprises, who rely on technology and quality to win customers, are very different from the business spirit currently based on advertising to improve visibility!	yes
没有实力的企业根本不可能做到这样，也不敢这么做！	It is impossible for a company that doesn't have the strength to do this, nor does it dare to do it!	yes
正是源于此，我才选择了华为。	This is why I chose Huawei.	yes
买来用了半年多了，感觉一直很好，非常不错。	I've been using it for over 6 months and it always felt good, very good.	yes
之所以没有给满分，是因为有一次在用它的离线导航时，出现了不定位现象，我最终没有找出原因，其他时候都很好。	The reason I didn't give full marks was because of the off-line navigation, and I didn't eventually figure out why, and the rest of the time was fine.	yes
而且它的在线输入好了目的地，搜索之后自动设计出路线，离开wifi出发以后，它自动离线导航的功能很实用，不用跑流量，它直接跟卫星对话来实现定位及导航，非常好！	And its online input is good at destination, it has automatically design route after search, it has an automatic offline navigation after leaving the wifi start, and it is practical, without having to run traffic, it speaks directly to the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, very good!	yes
索尼大法好	Sony Law is good.	yes
索尼的这种低端机，设计感依旧十足，而且价格便宜，屏幕够大，续航力一级棒，给老人使用很合适。	Sony's low-end mobile phone is still a good design, and is inexpensive, with a large screen and long service life, which makes it suitable for the elderly.	yes
虽然时间已经过去很久了，但这机器依旧没什么毛病。	While it's been a long time, the machine is still working perfectly well.	yes
不过因为我的Z2下放了，所以这台手机也完成了使命。	But since my Z2 is down, this phone has done the job.	yes

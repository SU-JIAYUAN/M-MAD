.h 预处理器文件; 通常不出现在命令行上其他后级名的文件被传递给连接器 (Linker).通常包括:	.h preprocessor file; Files with other post-level names that do not normally appear on the command line are passed to the Linker.	no
.0 目标文件 (Object file)	.0 Object file	no
.a 归档库文件(Archive file)	.a Archive file	no
除非使用了 -cec，-s, 或 -E 选项(或者编译错误阻止了完整的过程),否则连接总是最后的步骤.	Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process), the connection is always the last step.	no
在连接阶段中,所有对应于源程序的.e 文件，-1 库文件, 无法识别的文件名(包括指定的.o H 标文件和 .a 库文件)按命令行中的顺序传递给连接器选项 (OPTIONS)	During the connection phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, unrecognized file names (including the specified .o H standard file and .a library file) are passed to the connector options (OPTIONS) in the order in the command line	no
选项必须分立给出 : de ' 完全不同于 `-d -r '.	The options must be given discretely : de ' is completely different from '-d -r '.	no
大多数 ` -=E :和 `-W' 选项有两个相反的格式 : -fname 和 -fno-name (或 -Wname 和 -Wno- name).	Most ' -=E : and '-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno- name).	no
这里只列举不是默认选项的格式.	Only formats that are not default options are listed here.	no
下面是所有选项的摘要, 按类型分组, 解释放在后面的章节中.	Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, explained in later chapters.	no
代码生成选项 (Code Generation Option)	Code Generation Option	yes
总体选项 (Overall Option)	Overall Option	yes
明确指出后面输入文件的语言为 language (而不是从文件名后绥得到的默认选择).	Explicitly state that the language of the input file follows is language (not the default choice obtained from the filename).	yes
这个选项应用于后面所有的输入文件, 直到遇着下一个 `-x' 选项 .language 的可选	This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next '-x' option .language is available	yes
关闭任何对语种的明确说明, 因此依据文件名后级处理后面的文件 RE AS E ` -x' 选项).	Turn off any explicit description of the language, so process subsequent files according to the filename post-RE AS E '-x' option).	yes
如果只操作四个阶段( 预处理, 编译, 汇编, 连接)中的一部分, 可以使用 ` -x' 选项 (或文件名后 Ah) 告诉 geo 从哪里开始,用 `~-c' ，`-s' ,或 `-E' 选项告诉 geo 到哪里结束.注意,某些选项组合 (例如 ，`-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c 编译或汇编源文件, ETER. ERA ATI 缺省情况下， GCC 通过用 ` .o' 蔡换源文件名后级 ` .ec 标文件名. 可以使用-o 选项选择其他名字.GCC忽略 -ec 选项后面任何无法识别的输入文伯 -S F 何事情.	If you are only operating some of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, joining), you can use the '-x' option (or Ah after the filename) to tell geo where to start and '~-c', '-s', or '-E' to tell geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (e.g. ,'-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c to compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC is replaced by '.o' for the source filename followed by the '.ec filename.' You can use the -o option to select a different name. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the -ec option -S F Whatever.	yes
了的目标文件.	of the object file.	yes
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	Stop after compilation, no assembly is made.	yes
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	Work using pipes instead of temporary files between different stages of the compilation process, because the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from the pipes, GNU's assemblers do not have this problem, and the assembler can accept C "dialects": support for ANSI-compliant C programs.	yes
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This would turn off some of the GNU Cc incompatible ANSI Cc feature keywords, as well as ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, which indicate that they are rarely used, and forbidden despite their use. The corresponding independent environment (f£reestanding environment) does not have a standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. Please refer to the latest information on the GCC website for details)	yes
对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	For function declarations with no arguments, such as 'int foo(); ', treated in C style --- i.e. do not specify the number or type of parameters. (C++ only) .	no
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	Normally, such a function foo means that the argument is empty in C++.	no
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	The list of sections is removed from here to attempts to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.	no
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	See the NUC manual for details, we've removed the details, so that when the content becomes outdated, people won't HERI.	no
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the '-traditional' option brings an additional effect that allows assignment to this.	no
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	It has the same effect as the '-Ethis-is-variable' option.	no
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of legacy CC preprocessors.	no
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	In particular, the above mentioned content about preprocessors, but does not include other effects of the '-traditional' option.	no
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the '$' character in identifiers (C++ only).	no
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	You can specify the '''-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of the '$' character.	no
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	(GNU C++ allows the '$' character by default on some target systems, but not all.)	no
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of ant types to enumeration types (MEF c++).	no
正常情况下 GNU C++ 允许从 enum 到 int 的转换,反之则不行.	Normally, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.	no
-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	-fexternal-—templates produces smaller code (C++ only) for template declarations by generating only one copy of each template function where they are defined.	no
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	To use this option successfully, you must mark '#pragma implementatio' or '#Pragma interface' in all files that use templates.	no
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	When the program is compiled with '-fexternal-templates', template instantiation is all external types. You must have the required instances appear in the implementation file.	no
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	This can be achieved through typedef, which references each instance needed.	no
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	Correspondingly, if the default option '-fno-exteznal-templates' is used when compiling, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.	no
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All member functions (except constructors and the mnew or delete member operators) are treated as virtual functions of the class.	no
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	This does not indicate that each call to a member function will pass through the internal virtual function table.	no
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; At this point, it is called directly.	no
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch allows the type of the second and third arguments of the conditional expression to not match.	no
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	The value of such an expression is void.-fthis--is-variable allows assignment to this (C++ only).	no
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	Incorporating user-defined free storage management mechanisms into C++ makes the assignable 'this' seem out of place.	no
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	Therefore, by default, assigning a value to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.	no
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	However, for backward compatibility, you can make this work via the '-fthis-is-variable' option.	no
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.	no
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Each machine has its own default char type. It could be either unsigned char or signed char.	no
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the symbolism of data.	no
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	But many programs have been written with only simple char, and this is a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine on which the program is written).	no
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This option, and its antisense option, makes such a program work on the corresponding defaults.	no
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.	no
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	If the 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifier is not explicitly declared, these options are used to define either a signed bitfield or an unsigned bitfield.	no
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	By default, bitfields are signed, because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed numbers, however, if the '-traditional' option is specified, the bitfields are always unsigned.	no
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	-fwritable-strings store string constants in writable data segments without special treatment.	no
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	This is a very bad idea for compatibility with some older programs that change string constants, and the '-traditional' option has the same effect.	no

与此同时，各国政府削减了与毒品相关的预算。	At the same time, governments have cut drug-related budgets.	no
如果各国政府以同样的方式应对当前的经济衰退，预防吸毒和相关风险行为等干预措施和戒毒治疗服务可能会受到沉重打击。	If governments respond in the same way to the current economic downturn, interventions such as drug use prevention and related risk behaviours and treatment services could be hit hard.	no
此外，拦截行动和国际合作的优先性可能会降低，使贩运者更容易行动。	In addition, interdiction operations and international cooperation may be given less priority, making it easier for traffickers to operate.	no
一些国家有大量毒品通过商业航班走私，预计这些国家的贩毒活动受到的直接影响最大。	Drug trafficking is expected to be most directly affected by large quantities of drugs smuggled through commercial flights in some countries.	no
有信使将甲基苯丙胺等合成毒品放在随身背包或藏在私人行李中携带，有时数量很大。由于几乎各地都对航空客运实施了限制，利用商业航空旅行供应毒品的活动可能会完全中断。	Messengers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or hidden in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. With restrictions on air passenger transport imposed almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs could be completely disrupted.	no
尽管国际邮政供应链也受到了干扰，但利用暗网和货物邮寄进行贩运的活动可能会增加。	While international postal supply chains have also been disrupted, the use of the dark web and the mailing of goods for trafficking is likely to increase.	no
从长远来看，经济衰退和相关的封闭措施可能会打乱毒品市场。	In the long run, the economic downturn and related lockdowns could disrupt the drug market.	no
由于不断上升的失业率和缺乏机会，贫困和弱势人群将更有可能以有害的方式吸毒，患上吸毒病症，并转向与毒品有关的非法活动一无论是生产还是运输。	As a result of rising unemployment and lack of opportunity, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, suffer from drug use disorders, and turn to illegal drug-related activities, whether produced or transported.	no
贩毒组织可能会利用这种情况，向脆弱人群提供服务，并招募新成员来壮大队伍。	Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable populations and recruit new members to grow their ranks.	no
随着政府应对能力的降低，这些转变可能会快速扎根，成为许多社区的新现实。	As governments become less able to respond, these shifts could quickly take root and become a new reality for many communities.	no

在过去二十年期间，发展中国家吸毒情况的增长速度远远快于发达国家。	Over the past two decades, drug abuse in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.	no
这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。	To some extent, this reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, which was 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also reflects the relatively rapid growth of young populations in developing countries.	no
青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。	Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.	no
在2000-2018年期间，发展中国家这一年龄段的人口增长了16%,而发达国家这一年龄段的人口减少了10%。	Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group grew by 16 per cent in developing countries, while it decreased by 10 per cent in developed countries.	no
1城市化是当前和未来毒品市场的一个驱动因素	1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets	no
无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。	Drug abuse is higher in urban areas than in rural areas, in both developed and developing countries.	no
吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。	The overall increase in drug abuse is partly due to large-scale rural-urban migrations—more than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas, up from 34 per cent in 1960.	no
城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。	Urbanization could be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends were more pronounced.	no
财富的增加与吸毒情况增多相联，但承受疾病负担最大的是最贫穷的人在世界范围内，发达国家的吸毒情况比发展中国家更为普遍。	Increases in wealth were associated with increased drug abuse, but the poorest people who bear the greatest burden of disease worldwide were more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.	no
可卡因之类的毒品更是与世界上较富裕的地区联系较为牢固。	Drugs such as cocaine are more strongly linked to wealthier parts of the world.	no
同样，在各国内部，社会富裕阶层的吸毒流行率较高。	Similarly, within countries, drug abuse prevalence is higher among the wealthier segments of society.	no
但转为吸毒病症的比率较高的却是社会经济地位较低的人。	However, the higher rates of conversion to drug use disorders are among people of lower socioeconomic status.	no
来自少数几个国家的数据表明，有害的吸毒模式与病症同低收入之间存在联系。	Data from a few countries indicate a link between harmful patterns of drug abuse and conditions and low income.	no
这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。	These patterns seem to be less common in wealthier social classes.	no
全球新冠肺炎危机造成的经济制约很可能会加剧包括吸毒者在内的最弱势群体的风险。	The economic constraints caused by the global coronavirus crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable, including drug users.	no
例如，劳动力市场的变化，如失业率上升，过去一直与吸毒情况的增加有关，而这场疫情己经迫使全球数千万人失业。	For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked to an increase in drug use in the past, and the pandemic has forced tens of millions of people around the world to lose their jobs.	no
新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。	The pandemic may lead to more farmers growing illicit crops, either because the national authorities have less control over them, or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities during the economic crisis.	no
新冠肺炎的相关限制措施导致空中和陆路交通减少，海上贩运可能已经因此而增加，海上的拦截风险低，而且比空中或陆路走私的数量更多。	Coronavirus-related restrictions have reduced air and land traffic, and maritime trafficking may have increased as a result, with a low risk of interdiction at sea and more than smuggling by air or land.	no
最近已有报告称可卡因货物直接从南美经由海路运往欧洲。	There have recently been reports of cocaine shipments travelling directly from South America to Europe by sea.	no
复杂性增强	Increased complexity	yes
非国际管制物质的出现情况稳定，但有潜在危害的新型类阿片正在增多毒品市场正日趋复杂。	The emergence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but potentially harmful new opioids are increasing and the drug market is becoming increasingly complex.	yes
除大麻、可卡因和海洛因等植物类物质之外，已经增添了数百种合成毒品，其中许多并不在国际管制之下。药品的非医疗使用也快速增多。	In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of pharmaceuticals is also increasing rapidly.	yes
会员国的国内市场每年约有500种新型活性物质。	The domestic market of Member States is about 500 new active substances per year.	yes
目前其中大多是兴奋剂，其次是合成的大麻素受体激动剂和少量的类阿片。	Most of these are currently stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and small amounts of opioids.	yes
虽然新型精神活性物质的总体数量已经稳定下来，但比例发生了变化。	While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.	yes
在2014年确定的新型精神活性物质种类总数中，类阿片新型精神活性物质仅占2%,但到2018年，这一数字己上升至9%。	In 2014, opioids accounted for only 2% of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified, but by 2018 this figure had risen to 9%.	yes
类阿片新型精神活性物质中有许多是芬太尼的类似物，其药效和危害已得到证明，在北美导致了过量死亡事件，其他区域也有，但程度较轻。	Many of the new psychoactive substances in opioids are analogues of fentanyl, and their efficacy and harmfulness have been demonstrated, leading to overdose deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, in other regions.	yes
在北美，芬太尼有的用作海洛因和其他毒品（包括可卡因和甲基苯丙胺）的掺杂剂，有的用来制造假冒的药用类阿片。	In North America, fentanyl is used either as a dopant for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, or in the manufacture of counterfeit medicinal opioids.	yes
一些证据表明，欧洲也有注射新型精神活性物质兴奋剂的现象：一项对欧洲六个城市废弃注射器残留物的研宄发现，许多注射器都沾有产生兴奋作用的新型精神活性物质》	There is some evidence that new psychoactive stimulants are also injected in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that excitate their effects"	yes
2新型精神活性物质的使用可能会逐渐牢固存在于弱势群体中	2 The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly present among vulnerable groups	no
单一种类的新型精神活性物质几乎从未形成大的市场。	A single class of new psychoactive substances almost never forms a large market.	no
但来自欧洲的证据表明，合成大麻素在无家可归者和监狱囚犯等社会边缘群体中是一个严重的问题。	But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as homeless and prison inmates.	no
有22个国家报告了监狱中使用新型精神活性物质的情况，其中大多数国家将合成大麻素确定为主要挑战。	Twenty-two countries reported on the use of novel psychoactive substances in prisons, with most identifying synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.	no
对前体化学品的管制迫使制毒者进行创新最常作为前体用来合成苯丙胺、甲基苯丙胺和“摇头丸”等毒品的许多化学品已被置于国际管制之下。	The control of precursor chemicals had forced drug producers to innovate, and many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors for the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and "ecstasy" had been placed under international control.	no
贩毒者和制毒者一直在寻找替代品一不仅有管制较松的物质，还有专门为规避管制而设计的化学品，即所谓的“特制前体”。	Drug traffickers and producers have been looking for alternatives — not only loosely regulated substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, so-called "purpose-built precursors".	no
旨在阻止新冠肺炎传播的限制性措施很可能使依赖前体化学品的制毒者受到进一步挤压。	Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus are likely to further squeeze producers who rely on precursor chemicals.	no
来自墨西哥的证据表明，这已经成为 现实：据报告，2020年3月，从东亚进口的甲基苯丙胺前体短缺促使墨西哥和美国的甲基苯丙胺价格上涨。	Evidence from Mexico shows that this is already a reality: in March 2020, a reported shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia drove higher methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.	no
市场瞬息万变	The market is changing rapidly	no
合成药物在中亚和俄罗斯联邦取代阿片剂	Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation	no
中亚和俄罗斯联邦的阿片剂市场在2008年至2018年期间似乎发生了变化。	The opiate markets in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appear to have changed between 2008 and 2018.	no
俄罗斯联邦当局截获的阿片剂数量下降了约80%，同时因使用类阿片而接受治疗的人数大幅减少。	The number of opiates intercepted by the authorities of the Russian Federation had decreased by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use had dropped significantly.	no
但兴奋剂市场却似乎日渐兴旺。	But the doping market seems to be booming.	no
有证据表明，甲基苯丙胺和各种卡西酮，包括甲氧麻黄酮和 a - 吡咯烷基苯戊酮，现在俄罗斯毒品市场上随处可见。	There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including methoxyephedrone and a-pyrrolidinylvalerone, are now ubiquitous on the Russian drug market.	no
俄罗斯当局报告称，最近查获的制造各种非法药物的秘密加工点数量急剧上升，在两年内翻了一番多，2018年增至152个加工点。	Russian authorities reported a sharp rise in the number of recently seized clandestine laboratories for the manufacture of various illicit drugs, more than doubling in two years, to 152 in 2018.	no
阿富汗和伊拉克甲基苯丙胺市场增长	The methamphetamine market is growing in Afghanistan and Iraq	no
早在2012年，对医院、监狱和其他机构人员的调查就已经揭示了甲基苯丙胺在伊拉克的重要性。	As early as 2012, surveys of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.	no
结晶甲基苯丙胺已经成为“芬乃他林”和曲马多之外又一种令人担忧的主要药物。	Crystalline methamphetamine has become a major cause for concern in addition to fenataline and tramadol.	no
2015年的一项研宄进一步证实了这些发现，吸毒者表示大麻比“芬乃他林”或甲基苯丙胺更难获得。	These findings were further confirmed by a 2015 study in which drug users said marijuana was harder to obtain than "fenataline" or methamphetamine.	no
最近，伊拉克当局发现了多个甲基苯丙胺加工点，麻管局已对伪麻黄碱制剂的大批进口表示关切一甲基苯丙胺加工点将这些制剂用作前体。	Recently, the Iraqi authorities had discovered a number of methamphetamine processing sites, and the Board had expressed concern about the large import of pseudoephedrine preparations by one methamphetamine processing site as a precursor.	no
在阿富汗，甲基苯丙胺制造似乎始于2014年。	In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacturing appears to have begun in 2014.	no
自那时起，甲基苯丙胺的缉获量一直在稳步上升。	Since then, methamphetamine seizures have been steadily increasing.	no
但2019年上半年的缉获量一^657公斤——与上一年相比大幅骤增。	However, seizures in the first half of 2019 amounted to one^657 kg – a significant increase compared to the previous year.	no
在其他国家大量缉获了据认为源自阿富汗的甲基苯丙胺，这也表明该国的产量正在迅速上升。	The large seizures of methamphetamine, believed to originate in Afghanistan, in other countries also indicate that production in that country is rising rapidly.	no
政策变化和变化趋势	Policy changes and trends	yes
非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域大多有大麻使用增多的趋势	Most jurisdictions where non-medical cannabis use has been legalized have a trend towards increased cannabis use	yes
加拿大、乌拉圭和美国的11个法域允许制造大麻产品供非医疗使用。	Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.	yes
在其中多数法域，大麻使用自合法化以来有所增多，尽管在其他未将非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域也观察到了同样的趋势。	In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized the non-medical use of cannabis.	yes
在美国最早通过立法的两个州科罗拉多州和华盛顿州，成年人非医疗使用大麻的情况增加，特别是过去一个月以及每天或几乎每天使用的情况增多，自2012年起便已超过了全国平均水平。	In Colorado and Washington, the first two U.S. states to pass legislation, non-medical marijuana use by adults has increased, particularly in the past month and on a daily or near-daily basis, exceeding the national average since 2012.	yes
所有指标都显示，自2011年以来，乌拉圭的大麻使用情况有所增加，上月使用情况几乎翻了一番。	All indicators show an increase in cannabis use in Uruguay since 2011, with almost doubling last month.	yes
这表明增加的主要原因是经常和频繁使用大麻。	This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the regular and frequent use of cannabis.	yes
加拿大的短期数据也表明，2018年至2019年合法市场扩大的同时，使用量也在增加。	Canada's short-term data also shows that the legal market expanded in 2018-2019 as well as usage increased.	yes
然而，2019年仍有40%的大麻使用者靠非法来源获得某些产品。	However, 40% of cannabis users still obtained certain products from illegal sources in 2019.	yes
全球大麻药草缉获量暴跌的背后原因是大麻合法化？	The reason behind the collapse in global cannabis herb seizures is the legalization of cannabis?	yes
2018年，全球大麻药草缉获量降至20年来的最低水平，这是因为北美的缉获量下降，在过去10年中下降了 84%。	In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a decline in seizures in North America, which has fallen by 84% over the past 10 years.	no
相比之下，同期世界其他地区的缉获量几乎翻了一番。缉获的模式表明，旨在放开大麻市场的政策在下降中发挥了关键作用。	In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.	no
对新型精神活性物质的监管似乎有遏制作用在国内对新型精神活性物质的监管效果仍然很难评估。	The regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect, and the effect of domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances is still difficult to assess.	no
一些对新型精神活性物质采用不同监管制度的国家显示出不同的新型精神活性物质使用流行率。	Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence of new psychoactive substance use.	no
在另一些国家，通过国内立法后，新型精神活性物质使用情况有所减少。	In other countries, the adoption of domestic legislation has led to a decrease in the use of new psychoactive substances.	no
弱势群体面临合法和非法毒品市场的伤害用于疼痛管理和姑息治疗的药用类阿片主要在高收入国家提供止痛药在各区域分布不均。	Vulnerable groups face harm from both legal and illicit drug markets, and pharmaceutical opioids for pain management and palliative care are widely available in high-income countries and are unevenly distributed across regions.	no
2018年，所有可供医疗消费的药用类阿片中，90%以上在高收入国家。	In 2018, more than 90% of all medicinal opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.	no
大约50%在北美，40%在欧洲，还有2%在大洋洲。	About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe and 2% in Oceania.	no
这些国家的人口约占全球人口的12%。	These countries account for about 12% of the global population.	no
据估计，低收入和中等收入国家的人口占全球人口的88%,但消费的药用类阿片却不到10%。	It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries account for 88% of the global population but consume less than 10% of medicinal opioids.	no
获取药用类阿片的障碍与许多因素有关，包括立法、文化、卫生系统和处方做法。	Barriers to access to medicinal opioids are linked to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescribing practices.	no
较贫穷的人患吸毒病症的风险更大2018年约有3,560万人患有吸毒病症。	Poorer people are at greater risk of developing drug use disorders, with some 35.6 million people living with drug use disorders in 2018.	no
贫困、有限的教育和社会边缘化可能会增加吸毒病症风险，并加剧其后果。高收入国家的研宄证实了这一点，在这些研究中，个人不利的社会经济轨迹一不仅仅是他们在某一时间点的状况一也与吸毒病症风险有关。	Poverty, limited education and social marginalization can increase the risk of drug use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. This is confirmed by studies in high-income countries, where individuals' adverse socioeconomic trajectories are not only associated with their status at a certain point in time, but also with drug use risk disorders.	no
吸毒病症还会加深社会经济劣势，进一步增加失业、贫困和无家可归的风险，从而助长劣势的恶性循环。这些结果也可能与刑事司法系统内的侮辱性态度和后果有关。	Drug abuse also exacerbates socio-economic disadvantage and further increases the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thus contributing to a vicious circle of disadvantage. These results may also be related to humiliating attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.	no
妇女、少数民族和移民、性取向多样化群体、因武装冲突或灾难而流离失所的人以及农村环境中的人也可能受到吸毒病症的过重影响，或者在获得治疗服务方面遇到问题。	Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexually diverse groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disasters and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug abuse or have problems accessing treatment services.	no
根据估计因残疾和过早死亡而损失的健康寿命年数的残疾调整寿命年（DALY)指标，在过去10年中，有害的吸毒对范围更广的社会影响加重。	According to the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death, harmful drug use has exacerbated its wider social impact over the past 10 years.	no
2007年至2018年间，归因于吸毒的全球残疾调整寿命年数增加了 17%。	Between 2007 and 2018, the number of years of disability-adjusted life (DALYs) attributed to drug use increased by 17% globally.	no
注射吸毒者中常见的未经治疗的丙型肝炎导致的肝癌的相关残疾调整寿命年数增幅特别高——达到40%。	The increase in disability-adjusted life expectancy for liver cancer, which is common among injecting drug users, from untreated hepatitis C to liver cancer was particularly high – 40 per cent.	no
毒品和暴力之间的关系错综复杂很难确定精神活性物质的使用和暴力之间的所有因果关系。	The relationship between drugs and violence is complex, and it is difficult to establish all causal links between psychoactive substance use and violence.	no
全球范围的有限数据表明，迷醉可能是杀人的一个重要因素。	Limited data worldwide suggests that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.	no
但在暴力事件中，酒精的作用似乎比毒品更大。	But alcohol appears to play a greater role than drugs in violent incidents.	no
虽然吸毒可能会导致犯罪，但在某些情况下，这种联系可以部分归因于多种中介因素，如社会经济劣势以及由个人风险、家庭环境和同龄人影响造成的其他类型的逆境。	While drug use can lead to crime, in some cases this link can be attributed in part to a variety of mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.	no
贩毒和暴力之间的联系是多方面的。	The link between drug trafficking and violence is manifold.	no
如果已有稳定的犯罪结构，包括国际贩毒在内的大规模有组织犯罪活动有可能在无暴力的情况下实施。	If stable criminal structures exist, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, are likely to be carried out without violence.	no
短期内，暴力的存在和程度与其说取决于贩运的数量，不如说取决于造成有组织犯罪集团之间力量平衡不稳定的某些变化，例如非法市场规模的变化，知名罪犯的死亡或监禁，以及使一个集团弱于另一个集团的执法措施。	In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depends not so much on the volume of trafficking as on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.	no
最新趋势	Latest trends	yes
吸毒大麻是最常用的物质，类阿片危害最大	Drug marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most harmful	yes
据估计，2018年使用大麻的有 1.92 亿人，使之成为全球使用最多的毒品。	An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug globally.	yes
相比之下，2018年使用类阿片的有5,800万人。	By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.	yes
但阿片类药物的相关危害却因使用者较少而受到忽视。	But the harms associated with opioids are overlooked by the fact that they are fewer users.	yes
在2017年与吸毒病症有关的估计167,000例死亡中，有66%是这类物质造成的，在据信为吸毒导致的残疾或过早死亡而损失的2,100万年寿命中，有50%是这类物质造成的。	Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66 percent were caused by these substances, and 50 percent of the 21 million life years believed to be lost for disability, or premature death from drug use.	yes
合成类阿片的非医疗使用加剧了公共卫生危机	The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis	yes
在西非、中部非洲和北非，加剧类阿片危机的是曲马多；在北美则是芬太尼。这两个区域在经济、人口统计数据或一般吸毒模式方面几乎没有共同点，但都在奋力抗击由容易获得且生产成本低的物质助长的类阿片危机。	In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that exacerbates the opioid crisis; In North America, it's fentanyl. The two regions have little in common economically, demographically, or general drug use patterns, but both struggle with the opioid crisis fuelled by readily available and low-cost substances.	yes
在北美，芬太尼等合成类阿片的使用导致了20年来类阿片过量致死人数增加。	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to a 20-year increase in opioid overdose deaths.	yes
2018年，在美国登记的67,367例过量死亡中，有三分之二涉及芬太尼。	In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.	yes
加拿大也报告了类似的结果，只是数字较低。	Canada reported similar results, albeit at lower numbers.	no
芬太尼导致过量死亡的部分原因是非法药物市场上的芬太尼药效不可预测。	Part of the reason for overdose deaths is the unpredictable efficacy of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.	no
在西非、中部非洲和北非，非医疗用途曲马多的市场已有大幅增长。	In West, Central and North Africa, the market for tramadol for non-medical uses has grown substantially.	no
在该区域，接受治疗的曲马多使用病症患者越来越多。	In this region, an increasing number of patients are receiving treatment for tramadol use conditions.	no
2017年，全球截获的曲马多数量显著增加，达到125吨以上的峰值。	In 2017, the amount of tramadol intercepted globally increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tonnes.	no
但2018年，在印度通过一项监管曲马多的新法律之后，全球缉获量降至32吨。	But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating tramadol, global seizures fell to 32 tons.	no
促成这两地危机的是制造简单和生产成本低，此外还有对曲马多和许多芬太尼类似物或其前体缺乏国际监管。	The crisis has contributed to the simplicity and low cost of production, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.	no
使这两地危机恶化的是这些物质在药品市场和非法市场上都有供应，因而更加难以发现和防止其滥用。	The crises in both regions are exacerbated by the availability of these substances on both drug and illicit markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.	no
兴奋剂使用不断增多	Doping use is increasing	no
兴奋剂领域以可卡因和甲基苯丙胺为主，这两种物质在其主要市场的使用量都在上升。	The stimulants sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in their use in their major markets.	no
2018年使用可卡因的约有1,900万人，因为可卡因在北美和西欧颇为流行。	About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is prevalent in North America and Western Europe.	no
同年使用苯丙胺的约有2,700万人，其中甲基苯丙胺是东南亚和北美使用最多的苯丙胺类兴奋剂。	Some 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.	no
根据所掌握的多数指标，20年来这两个区域甲基苯丙胺的使用一直在扩大。	According to most available indicators, the use of methamphetamine has been expanding in both regions over the past 20 years.	no
在一些市场上，可卡因和甲基苯丙胺可以共存，有时是相互替代，这样一种药物的使用量上升时另一种药物的使用量就下降，有时是同时增加和减少以满足同一市场的需求。	In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes as substitutes for each other, so that the use of one drug increases and the use of the other decreases, sometimes increasing and decreasing at the same time to meet demand in the same market.	no
新冠肺炎使注射吸毒者的风险增高	The coronavirus increases the risk of injecting drug users	no
据估计，2018年注射吸毒的约有1,130万人，全球艾滋病毒感染约有10%是注射吸毒造成的。	An estimated 11.3 million people injected drug use in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drug use.	no
注射吸毒者感染艾滋病毒的超过100万人，患丙型肝炎的有550万人。	More than 1 million people who inject drugs are infected with HIV and 5.5 million people suffer from hepatitis C.	no
2017年，因吸毒死亡的约有 58.5万人，其中一半死于丙型肝炎引起的肝病，而注射吸毒者的丙型肝炎大多仍未得到治疗。	In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of them from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most people who injected drugs remained untreated.	no
5 新冠肺炎限制措施造成的类阿片短缺可能导致使用者代之以酒精或苯二氮类药物等更容易获得的物质，或者将类阿片与合成药物混合。	5 Opioid shortages caused by COVID restrictions may result in users replacing them with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or mixing opioids with synthetic drugs.	no
随着一些使用者改用注射或更频繁地注射，可能会出现更多有害的使用方式。	As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful ways of using them may occur.	no

欧盟峰会为难民政策争论，欧盟官员：接收过程步步瓶颈-中新网	EU summit debates refugee policy, EU officials: step-by-step bottleneck in the reception process - Chinanews.com	yes
欧盟峰会为难民政策争吵不休，欧盟官员：接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈	EU summit squabbles over refugee policy, EU officials: there are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process	yes
【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	According to Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit on the same day, European Commission President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.	yes
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	The EU's move is reportedly a response to Europe's growing concerns about illegal immigration, which today has a central problem of the small number of illegal immigrants who can eventually be repatriated.	yes
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funds" to strengthen external borders with means such as infrastructure and surveillance.	yes
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	However, the EU has squabbled with member states over issues such as the payment of fencing fees.	yes
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not pay for them.	yes
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	But diplomats in some member states say that if the EU can share the installation of cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along external borders, it will free up national budgets to speed up the construction process.	yes
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	EU officials acknowledge that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, that limited reception capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states cannot prevent refugees from submitting "myriad" asylum claims across the EU, and that the EU's refugee reception system is in a near-"permanent crisis".	yes
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half more than the previous year.	yes
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.	no
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	In this context, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries can repatriate illegal immigrants based on a court decision of another member state.	no
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	In addition, EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of a safe state," which would open the way for the EU to develop a common list.	no

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	The United States upgraded the "chip war" to hit the global semiconductor industry hard-Chinanews.com	yes
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	Recently, the United States' "chip war" against China has greatly escalated - first, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to start the control of the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China under pressure from the United States; Later, foreign media reported that the US government is considering cutting off all contact between US suppliers and Huawei, and prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; The Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order restricting U.S. investment in sensitive Chinese tech sectors... Soon after the beginning of 2023, the United States has continued to make vicious moves to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.	yes
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	In recent years, the United States has never stopped cracking down on the development of China's "core", while accurately suppressing the semiconductor production and supply chain in China, while building a "de-Chinese" semiconductor industry chain alliance, in an attempt to completely "shake off" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.	yes
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it is to win over South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or to establish a chip "quadripartite alliance" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a "small circle" of the semiconductor industry chain through mechanisms such as the "quadrilateral mechanism" and "Indo-Pacific economic framework" of the United States, Japan, India and Australia, the United States introduces politicization, camp and weaponization into the semiconductor industry in an attempt to build a closed production and supply chain cycle led by the United States, thereby making up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintaining its dominant position in the global chip industry.	yes
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	However, the "core tactics" of the United States against China with great fanfare are also "wounded by a thousand enemies and self-inflicted damage by eight hundred."	yes
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	Recently, Lam Research, a well-known US chip manufacturing equipment supplier, announced that it will lay off 1,300 full-time employees due to the latest round of the ban on the export of chip manufacturing equipment to China, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.	yes
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	Global lithography giant ASML Holding in the Netherlands recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.	yes
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	US media analysis, after the US government carried out a brutal suppression of China's chip and semiconductor industries, many American companies suffered from it, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, etc.	yes
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.	yes
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has long formed a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain.	yes
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	According to professional estimates, based on the professional division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the borders of various countries more than 70 times, and the whole process reaches 100 days.	no
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, its manufacturing capabilities, especially advanced process technology, are relatively weak and rely heavily on East Asia.	no
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	Even if the United States strives to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the regionalization of the "small circle" led by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of global semiconductor-related industries are difficult to change.	no
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The United States has strongly "reshaped" the "de-Chinese" semiconductor industry chain and severely damaged the global semiconductor industry.	no
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the participation of all countries around the world.	no
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introducing the Innovation and Competition Act, the American COMPETES Act of 2022, and the Chip and Science Act, using scientific and technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership; To the allies, "Enwei and Shi", induce Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other chip manufacturing companies to set up factories in the United States, and strive to ensure the global leadership of the United States in the field of chips.	no
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	In the short term, the United States has indeed created trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and reaped practical benefits.	no
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	However, in the long run, the United States' hysterical suppression has forced China's chip industry to continue to break through, making itself lose the huge Chinese market, which will eventually greatly weaken the innovation willingness and innovation ability of American technology companies and damage the development of the global chip industry.	no

去年11月银保监会制定了《商业银行和理财公司个人养老金业务管理暂行办法 》 。	In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Individual Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies."	no
《办法》规定，参加人可以通过个人养老金资金账户购买个人养老储蓄、个人养老金理财产品、个人养老金保险产品、个人养老金公募基金产品等个人养老金产品。	The Measures stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, individual pension insurance products, individual pension public fund products and other personal pension products through individual pension fund accounts.	no
随后，人社部、财政部、国家税务总局三部门发布通知，明确个人养老金制度在北京、天津，以及河北石家庄、雄安新区，山西晋城市等36个先行城市和地区启动实施。	Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice clarifying that the individual pension system will be implemented in 36 pilot cities and regions, including Beijing and Tianjin, as well as Shijiazhuang, Xiong'an New Area and Jincheng City in Shanxi.	no

健身行业应摆脱信任危机-中新网	The fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust - Chinanews.com	yes
又一大型健身房“暴雷”？	Another big gym "Thunderstorm"?	yes
近日，知名健身机构中健健身会员维权问题引起社会关注。	Recently, the issue of protecting the rights of members of Zhongjian Fitness in well-known fitness institutions has attracted social attention.	yes
春节后不少会员发现自己所在门店没有正常营业，随后，关于该机构倒闭跑路的传闻引起会员恐慌，导致公安、人社部门介入。	After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally, and subsequently, rumors about the collapse of the institution caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of public security and human resources and social security departments.	yes
最后，该机构相关负责人出面回应，承诺会努力保障好员工和会员的合法权益，风波才得以平息。	Finally, the relevant person in charge of the institution responded and promised to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the turmoil was calmed down.	yes
个别健身机构的部分门店出现经营问题，暂时关闭，消费者本可心平气和等待问题解决，为何不少会员的第一反应是“大事不妙”？	Some stores of some fitness institutions have business problems and are temporarily closed, consumers can be calm and wait for the problem to be solved, why is the first reaction of many members is "something is not good"?	yes
健身俱乐部会员维权风波背后，是行业信任危机的深层次问题。	Behind the storm of health club members' rights protection is the deep-seated problem of the industry's trust crisis.	yes
国内传统健身房普遍采取预付费模式，“赚用户不来的钱”是其发展的底层逻辑。	Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and "making money that users do not come" is the underlying logic of their development.	yes
通过预售会员卡获取现金流，不断开新店，看似能够循环往复，实则寅吃卯粮，无法形成稳定的盈利模式。	Obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and constantly opening new stores seems to be able to repeat itself, but in fact, it is impossible to form a stable profit model.	yes
健身房跑路等行业负面信息频频传出，对消费者信心造成强烈冲击。	Negative information in industries such as gym runs is frequently reported, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.	yes
从市场前景看，健身房当然算得上是一门有“钱途”的好生意。	From the perspective of market prospects, gyms are certainly a good business with "money".	no
健身赛道虽然起起伏伏，但始终受到资本关注。	The fitness track, despite its ups and downs, has always received capital attention.	no
多项数据显示，文体消费等领域热度不断攀升，市场持续回暖。	A number of data show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption and other fields continues to rise, and the market continues to recover.	no
具体到健身市场，随着居民生活水平稳步提高，健康生活理念深入人心，健身行业发展大有可为。	Specific to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards, the concept of healthy life is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the development of the fitness industry is promising.	no
形势越是趋好，行业越需重视发展质量。	The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.	no
然而，个别机构对消费复苏后的健身市场盲目乐观，刚从危机中走出来，又吹响开疆拓土的号角，把融资资金一股脑投入新店建设上。	However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption, just came out of the crisis, and sounded the clarion call to open up territory, and invested financing funds in the construction of new stores.	no
不可否认，这几年受疫情影响，不少机构退出，行业重新洗牌，有实力的企业此时选择性地加大收购力度、重新布局，未尝不是新机遇。	It is undeniable that in recent years, affected by the epidemic, many institutions have withdrawn, the industry has been reshuffled, and powerful enterprises have selectively increased their acquisition efforts and rearranged at this time, which is not a new opportunity.	no
但是，健身市场发展要想进入良性循环，迈上行稳致远的康庄大道，行业就必须改变传统模式，改变经营策略。	However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous circle and move up the road of stability and long-term prosperity, the industry must change the traditional model and change the business strategy.	no
只有稳扎稳打，重新建立起消费者的信任度、安全感，才能真正赢得市场、赢得未来。	Only by steadily and steadily re-establishing consumers' trust and sense of security can we truly win the market and win the future.	no
相比大建新店抢占市场，健身行业当前更需要的是沉下心来优化服务，用高质量发展来稳住用户。	Compared with building new stores to seize the market, the fitness industry currently needs to sink down to optimize services and stabilize users with high-quality development.	no
首先，要靠服务留住用户。	First of all, rely on service to retain users.	no
健身房属于服务行业，其本质是坚持“用户导向”，要紧紧围绕用户需求，把经营重心放在服务提质升级上。	Gym belongs to the service industry, its essence is to adhere to "user orientation", to closely focus on user needs, to focus on service quality upgrade.	no
其次，要靠数字化转型提升用户体验。	Second, digital transformation is needed to improve user experience.	no
比如当下流行的互联网健身房模式，实现用户按次付费和场地自选。	For example, the popular Internet gym model realizes user pay-per-use and venue selection.	no
同时，身体数据、运动数据得以有效利用，还可以满足社交需求，实现从线上到线下完整的服务闭环。	At the same time, body data and exercise data can be effectively used, and social needs can be met to achieve a complete service closed loop from online to offline.	no
没有私教推销，没有巨额年卡，用户对健身机构“跑路”的担忧降低了，信任感也就提升了。	Without personal training sales, no huge annual passes, users' worries about the "running away" of fitness institutions are reduced, and trust is improved.	no
另外，还要积极探索多元业态。	In addition, we must actively explore diversified business formats.	no
如今，体育消费已经从单一服务走向场景消费，健身俱乐部有望成为消费新入口，围绕健身所需的运动补给和健身器械等周边产品或将成为新的盈利点，为消费者提供更丰富选择。	Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from a single service to scene consumption, fitness clubs are expected to become a new entrance to consumption, and peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment required for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with richer choices.	no

这家位于江北新区的楼盘名为保利扬子萃云台，看房人孙先生告诉记者，他在上周末逛楼盘时发现了一则“声明”。	The property in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai, and Mr. Sun, a house watcher, told reporters that he found a "statement" while visiting the property last weekend.	yes
他发给记者的图片上显示，该楼盘的开发商承诺，凡是在2月1日-2月28日期间购买房源的，自双方签订买卖合同之日起至对应房源交付，若该项目其他房源的优惠折扣大于之前购房所享折扣的(限与该商品房属于同一户型、同一楼栋、同一单元、同一物业类型的其他未售商品房)，开发商可以为购房者换房并退还差价。	The picture he sent to reporters shows that the developer of the real estate promises that if the property is purchased between February 1 and February 28, from the date of signing the sales contract between the two parties to the delivery of the corresponding listing, if the discount of other listings in the project is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous purchase (limited to other unsold commercial houses belonging to the same type, the same building, the same unit, and the same property type as the commercial house), the developer can exchange houses for the buyer and refund the difference.	yes
孙先生表示，置业顾问表示这其实就是一份“保价协议”，目的是让买家放心出手，不用担心开发企业降价促销，“现在就怕买完了它就降价了，去售楼处闹吧没时间，不闹的话也确实窝心”。	Mr. Sun said that the property consultant said that this is actually a "price insurance agreement", the purpose of which is to let buyers feel at ease, do not have to worry about the development company's price reduction promotion, "now I am afraid that after buying it, I will reduce the price, go to the sales office to make trouble, there is no time, if you do not make trouble, it is indeed comfortable."	yes
还有不少买房人则认为，“保价协议”虽然是在给购房者吃“定心丸”，不过条件却不低。	There are also many buyers who believe that although the "price insurance agreement" is giving buyers a "reassuring pill", the conditions are not low.	yes
打算在江北买一套刚需房的郑女士说，保价的房源首先是要同一户型，还得在同一楼栋、同一个单元，买家可以比价的房源寥寥，因此“门槛”还是蛮高的。	Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a just-needed house in Jiangbei, said that the insured housing must first be the same type, but also in the same building and the same unit, and there are few houses that buyers can compare prices with, so the "threshold" is still quite high.	yes
也有购房者认为，由于信息不对称，销售时不排除给出额外的让利，买家“维权”的难度不小。	Some buyers believe that due to information asymmetry, additional concessions are not ruled out when selling, and it is not easy for buyers to "protect their rights".	yes
能否留住买房人有待观察	It remains to be seen whether it will be possible to retain buyers	no
记者在南京网上房地产上查询得知，该楼盘于去年11月首领两幢楼共计252套房源的销许，户型面积有105平方米、114平方米、129平方米等，全装修销许均价为39843元/㎡。	The reporter inquired on Nanjing online real estate and learned that the property was sold in November last year for a total of 252 houses in the two buildings, with a unit area of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., and the average price of full decoration sales was 39,843 yuan / ㎡.	no
不过两个多月过去，网上房地产显示目前该楼盘的未售总套数为157套，占比为62.3%，其中8号楼共计128套，未售套数达113套，7号楼的124套中也有44套未售，项目的总成交套数只有33套，占比仅为13%。	However, more than two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the property is currently 157 units, accounting for 62.3%, of which Building 8 has a total of 128 units, the number of unsold units reaches 113 sets, and 44 sets of 124 units in Building 7 are also unsold, and the total number of completed units of the project is only 33 sets, accounting for only 13%.	no
市场人士介绍，“保价协议”在2008年也曾在南京出现过。	According to market sources, the "price insurance agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.	no
当年8月份，河西黄山路上的楼盘横塘西苑为了吸引买房人眼球，推出了《保价计划》，具体内容为“公司郑重承诺，若一年内项目优惠幅度扩大，由此产生的差额，公司将按差额退还给老业主”。	In August of that year, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate project on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched the "Price Insurance Plan" in order to attract the attention of buyers, the specific content of which was "the company solemnly promises that if the preferential range of the project is expanded within one year, the company will refund the difference to the old owner according to the difference".	no
此后2011年4月，南京也有9家楼盘拿出部分房源承诺“差价赔付”。	Since then, in April 2011, 9 real estate projects in Nanjing have taken out some listings and promised to "pay the difference".	no
“楼市在回暖，此时更需要一针‘强心剂’。	"The property market is picking up, and at this time, a 'booster' is needed.	no
”南京地产行业一位资深操盘手沈先生表示，“保价协议”也是房企的营销方式之一。	Mr. Shen, a senior trader in Nanjing's real estate industry, said that the "price insurance agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of real estate enterprises.	no
他认为如今开发企业比买房人更需要信心，推出“保价协议”其实也是在给其打气。	He believes that developers need confidence more than buyers, and the introduction of "price insurance agreements" is actually encouraging them.	no
至于能否留住买房人，他表示这取决于调控政策、贷款门槛等多重因素的影响，就目前来看仍有待观察。	As for whether it can retain buyers, he said that it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, and it remains to be seen for now.	no

新华社台北2月11日电(记者赵博、黄扬)出口贸易额“连五黑”，制造业采购经理人指数(PMI)连续7个月紧缩，消费者物价指数(CPI)又见“3字头”……近期，台湾当局陆续发布2023年1月经济数据。	Taipei, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Export trade volume is "five blacks", the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) has tightened for seven consecutive months, and the consumer price index (CPI) has seen "three characters"...

统计显示，1月台湾地区进出口双降，出超金额仅23.4亿美元，创近3年来最低水平。	Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports fell in January, with an excess of only US$2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.	yes
台当局财政事务主管部门认为，全球终端需求减少，产业调整库存抑制厂商购料意愿，出口颓势短期难见改善，台湾今年首季出口衰退恐高于预期。	The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that the global terminal demand has decreased, the industrial adjustment of inventories has inhibited manufacturers' willingness to buy materials, and it is difficult to see an improvement in the short-term export decline, and Taiwan's export recession in the first quarter of this year may be higher than expected.	no
据台湾中华经济研究院发布，今年1月台湾制造业采购经理人指数(PMI)经季节调整后为40.4%，较去年12月续跌3.3个百分点，连续7个月紧缩。	According to Taiwan's Chung Hua Institute of Economic Research, Taiwan's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) in January this year was 40.4% seasonally adjusted, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, tightening for seven consecutive months.	no

展望今年台湾经济，综合《联合报》、“Yahoo财经”等岛内媒体报道，专家表示悲观。	Looking forward to Taiwan's economy this year, experts expressed pessimism based on media reports on the island such as Lianhe Pao and Yahoo Finance.	no
台“中央大学”经济系教授吴大任分析，出口衰退可能造成出口制造业厂商现金流出现问题，债务违约风险上升。	Wu Daren, a professor at the Department of Economics of Taiwan's "Central University", analyzed that the export recession may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing manufacturers, and the risk of debt default will increase.	no
同时，订单减少导致厂商削减人力成本，影响劳动市场和家庭经济，反过来冲击消费能力。	At the same time, the reduction in orders has led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn affects consumption capacity.	no
台湾经济研究院研究员邱达生认为，今年欧美通胀状况未解，需求持续萎缩，预估台湾出口衰退会延续到上半年。	Chiu Tat-seng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that this year's inflation situation in Europe and the United States is unresolved, demand continues to shrink, and it is expected that Taiwan's export recession will continue to the first half of the year.	no

“无内容，不电商”，随着短视频和直播电商不断发展，人们对电商内容的要求和标准正步入新阶段。	"No content, no e-commerce", with the continuous development of short video and live broadcast e-commerce, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.	no

报告认为，电商行业内容生态是一个综合性概念，是将电商与内容进行整合，但并非所有内容都可与电商整合，好的PGC(专业生产内容)与UGC(用户原创内容)才是与电商进行整合的优质载体，内容平台价值越高，消费与推广的场景也就越来越丰富，电商植入的可能性也就越高，商业价值也就越强，这种公共领域和私人领域逐步集成分布的电商内容生产和内容消费的比例也就会越高。	The report believes that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept, is to integrate e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce, good PGC (professionally produced content) and UGC (user-generated content) is a high-quality carrier for integration with e-commerce, the higher the value of the content platform, the richer the consumption and promotion scenarios, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, the stronger the commercial value.

同时，内容成为电商发展新阶段的根本和抓手，知识付费、专业性知识、KOL(关键意见领袖)等PGC内容开始在电商直播中成为标配。	At the same time, content has become the foundation and starting point for the new stage of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, and KOLs (key opinion leaders) have begun to become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.	no

从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	From the total point of view, there are many one-time and technical factors in this data, such as the return of teachers and staff from strike, the revision of the survey statistical caliber, and the update of the seasonal adjustment factor, which may be revised in the future (referring to the new non-farm payrolls revised down from 504,000 to 364,000 in January 2022), and non-farm payrolls may not be as strong as the data reflects.	yes
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; New jobs in high-touch service industries such as leisure and hospitality, education and health care have rebounded sharply, and the data shows that the labor gap in the service industry still exists.	yes
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Combined with the recovery in the same better-than-expected services PMI, job openings and labor gap data and strong consumer credit data, we judge that the US services sector has ushered in a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.	yes
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	In our view, the tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market is unlikely to improve without a recession.	yes
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	At present, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million yuan in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is slowly rising, especially the labor force participation rate for 25-54 years old is close to the pre-epidemic high.	yes
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	In addition, due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit in the United States, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of tightening on the job market.	yes
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	The continued tight supply and demand in the US job market will be the background color of the US economy in 2023.	yes
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	Coupled with the fact that the end of the interest rate hike is nearing and inflation expectations are constantly repeating, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.	no
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Before the release of this data, the US stock and bond exchange market was too optimistic about the Fed's interest rate hike path.	no
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	As inflation data continues to improve, the Fed has shortened the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining a fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statements, not only expecting to stop raising interest rates early, but also expecting two rate cuts at the end of the year.	no
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	In the context of tight supply and demand in the labor market and unclear impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance for interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded trading may cause some harm to the market.	no
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	Nevertheless, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with the M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-leading indicators, since October the US CPI data has turned to a rapid decline stage, the stubbornness of wage growth will only form a foundation for future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of game after the next inflation data is released.	no
杉杉创始人郑永刚因突发心脏疾病过世 曾带领中国服装第一股转型 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Shanshan founder Zheng Yonggang passed away due to sudden heart disease and led the transformation of China's first garment stock - Economic Observation Network - Professional financial news website	yes
经济观察网 记者 郑淯心 2月11日，认证主体为杉杉控股有限公司（以下简称“杉杉控股 ” ） 的微信公众号发布讣告，杉杉企业创始人、杉杉控股董事局主席郑永刚因突发心脏疾病救治无效，于2023年2月10日去世，享年65岁。	Economic Observation Network Reporter Zheng Huixin On February 11, the WeChat public account of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") released an obituary that Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to ineffective treatment of sudden heart disease.	yes
上世纪80年代，郑永刚担任国营棉纺厂的厂长，随着调任，1989年郑永刚成为杉杉股份的前身宁波云港服装总厂的厂长。	In the 80s of last century, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of the state-owned cotton spinning factory, and with the transfer, in 1989 Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment General Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd.	yes
2022年12月，在第二十届中国企业领袖年会暨第二十二届中国企业未来之星年会上，郑永刚在演讲中称，在上世纪90年代的中国西服市场，杉杉品牌的市占率曾高达37 % 。	In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of Future Stars of Chinese Enterprises, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 90s of last century, the market share of the Shanshan brand was as high as 37%.	yes
1996年杉杉股份（600884.SH）上市，成为中国服装业第一家上市公司。	In 1996, Shanshan shares (600884. SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's garment industry.	yes
就在服装业务如日中天时，杉杉集团却开始转型，因为郑永刚意识到 ， “ 一旦市场放开，中国品牌自然会形成一个梯队式品牌市场，杉杉西服想一直独领风骚，长期成为国人的国服的可能性不大 ” 。	Just when the clothing business was in full swing, Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened, Chinese brands will naturally form an echelon brand market, and Shanshan Suit wants to always lead the way, and it is unlikely that it will become the national uniform of Chinese people for a long time".	yes
1999年，杉杉开始研究企业转型，郑永刚回忆当年 ， “ 我们来到上海，寻求到底转型做什么，专门找了很多专家学者，连续不断地开一些诸葛亮会、务虚研讨会。	In 1999, Shanshan began to study enterprise transformation, and Zheng Yonggang recalled, "We came to Shanghai, looking for what the transformation did, and specially found many experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings and retreat seminars.	yes
最后，我们设定了两个大的战略方向。	In the end, we set two broad strategic directions.	yes
第一个方向是新能源新材料，另外一个是大健康有未来 ” 。	The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is that great health has a future."	yes
战略方向确定后，杉杉开始寻找合作，那时候鞍山热能院为鞍钢配套的炭素研究所在做国家863课题，科研经费不够，于是杉杉和鞍山热能院碳素研究所签署合作协议，共同推动国家863课题“中间相炭微球”项目产业化，从事负极材料的研发、生产和销售，在国内实现负极材料的商用推广。	After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to look for cooperation, at that time, Anshan Thermal Energy Institute for Angang supporting the carbon research institute was doing the national 863 project, scientific research funds were not enough, so Shanshan and Anshan Thermal Energy Institute Carbon Research Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "mesophase carbon microspheres" project, engaged in the research and development, production and sales of anode materials, and realize the commercial promotion of anode materials in China.	yes
2001年，杉杉股份实现中间相炭微球的规模化生产，开始国产化替代，取代日本成为国内中间相炭微球主要供应商。	In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. realized the large-scale production of mesophase carbon microspheres and began to replace it locally, replacing Japan as the main supplier of mesophase carbon microspheres in China.	no
这是中国第一家锂离子电池负极材料生产企业，实现了锂离子电池负极材料国产化。	This is the first lithium-ion battery anode material manufacturer in China, and has realized the localization of lithium-ion battery anode materials.	no
随着锂电池的应用迅速普及，杉杉股份的锂电池业务开始逐步发展，2007年锂电材料业务被写入了杉杉股份的主营业务，服装业务营收占比逐年减少，直至2013年，杉杉股份的锂电材料业务收入全面超过服装业务。	With the rapid popularization of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Shanshan Co., Ltd. began to develop gradually, in 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into the main business of Shanshan Co., Ltd., and the proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year, until 2013, Shanshan Co., Ltd.'s lithium battery material business income fully exceeded the clothing business.	no
2021年2月，杉杉股份成功并购LG化学偏光片业务，进军LCD偏光片市场，并成立偏光片企业杉金光电，该领域技术含量比较高，杉杉的主要的竞争对手都是世界500强，如韩国三星、日本的住友化学、日东电工。	In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established a polarizer enterprise Shanjin Optoelectronics, which has a relatively high technical content in this field, and Shanshan's main competitors are the world's top 500, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko.	no
郑永刚曾分享过投后管理的心得 ， “ 中国的民营企业收购国际上的一些高科技企业，成功概率比较低，为什么那些收购会失败？	Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management, "China's private enterprises acquire some international high-tech enterprises, the probability of success is relatively low, why do those acquisitions fail?	no
因为大家都会去考虑，我花了那么多钱，我得去派人管对吧，这是通常会做的一个行为 ” ， 然而郑永刚则不同，杉杉收购成功的那一天，郑永刚就到杉金光电当众宣布，杉杉作为杉金的大股东，决定实施一企两制，除了郑永刚担任董事长，杉杉企业的人不派到杉金，采取授权经营的方式，原有的分配制度、企业文化、各项管理等模式不变。	Because everyone will think about it, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to manage it, right, this is an act that is usually done", but Zheng Yonggang is different, the day of the successful acquisition of Shanshan Zheng, Zheng Yonggang went to Shanjin Optoelectronics to announce in public that Shanshan as the major shareholder of Shanjin, decided to implement one enterprise and two systems, except for Zheng Yonggang as the chairman, the people of Shanshan enterprise are not sent to Shanjin, and the original distribution system, corporate culture, various management and other models remain unchanged.	no

阿拉斯加上空被击落的 “物体”究竟是什么？	What exactly is the downed "object" over Alaska?	yes
扑朔迷离，猜测纷纷	Confused, speculative	yes
美国军方周五（2月10日）下午再次动用美国最先进的隐身喷气战机F-22击落了一个在美国阿拉斯加上空飞行的尚未确定身份的物体。	On Friday (February 10) afternoon, the U.S. military again used the U.S. most advanced stealth jet F-22 to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska, USA.	yes

五角大楼说，第二个被击落的物体于周四晚上首次进入美国领空，在阿拉斯加东北部上空移动时被美国军方跟踪，飞行高度为1.2万米（4万英尺），其大小与一辆小型汽车差不多，与先前被击落的那个中国间谍气球相比要小很多。	The Pentagon said the second downed object, which first entered U.S. airspace Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeast Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet) about the size of a small car and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that had been shot down earlier.	yes
五角大楼还认为，目前没有迹象显示，这个物体是可操纵的。	The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no indication that the object is manipulable.	yes
白宫国家安全委员会战略沟通协调员约翰·科比周五表示，虽然这个在高空飞行的物体的具体样子尚不清楚，但它“对民航飞机的安全构成了合理的威胁”。	John Bryant, the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, said Friday that while the exact appearance of the high-altitude object is unclear, it "poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."	yes

科比说，“我们把它称为一个‘物体’是我们目前能够作出的最好的描述”。	"We call it an 'object' the best we can describe it right now," Bryant said.	no
拜登总统在下令击落这个物体之前听取了五角大楼的建议，他作出这个决定的时候“非常谨慎”，科比补充说。	President Biden, who listened to the Pentagon's advice before ordering the shooting down of the object, was "very cautious" in making the decision, Bryant added.	no
美国官方对这个物体的描述大致可以归纳为：大小相当于一辆小汽车，没有操纵杆，没有悬挂装置，飞行高度为一万米左右。	The official description of this object in the United States can be roughly summarized as: the size of a small car, no joystick, no suspension device, and the flight altitude is about 10,000 meters.	no
但这些信息还无法回答基本问题，比如这个物体究竟是什么东西，它属于哪个国家，它在执行什么任务。	But this information doesn't yet answer basic questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is performing.	no
目前网上许多的分析和猜测认为，这可能又是一只中国气球。	At present, many analysis and speculation on the Internet believe that this may be another Chinese balloon.	no

也有人把阿拉斯加的这个“物体”与“不明飞行物”（UFO）联系在一起。	Others associate this "object" in Alaska with a "UFO."	no
美国新闻周刊的报道引用美国前众议员彼得·梅杰（Peter Meijer）周五在推特上发出的推文说，“真希望这个‘不明飞行物’也是一个间谍气球，而不是一个合法的UFO”。	The U.S. Newsweek report quoted former U.S. Representative Peter Meijer as tweeting on Friday as saying, "I wish this UFO was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO."	no
“将外星飞船与气象气球混为一谈的讽刺意味很令人惊讶，但这不值得引发一场星际冲突，”梅杰说。	"The irony of confusing alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it's not worth triggering an interstellar conflict," Major said.	no
梅杰是在科比证实阿拉斯加的这个物体被击落之后不久发出这个推文的。	Major tweeted shortly after Bryant confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.	no
新闻周刊说，怀疑这个物体是UFO的不止是梅杰一人。	Newsweek said Major wasn't the only one who suspected the object was a UFO.	no

客观来讲，我没有证据证明我没有损坏商品，但是以我在亚马逊购物的信用记录来讲，我认为这样的商品不应该出现在亚马逊自营商品中，客户选择亚马逊自营就是信任，customer win，we win，客户的胜利就是厂商的胜利，希望大家一起努力改进，谢谢。	Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I have not damaged the goods, but in terms of my credit history of Amazon shopping, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon self-operated goods, customers choose Amazon self-operated is trust, customer win, we win, the victory of customers is the victory of the manufacturer, I hope everyone works together to improve, thank you.	yes
我使用该产品不到一年，就出现两个E2，我不知道如何处理?	I have been using the product for less than a year and two E2s appear, I don't know how to deal with it?	yes
我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?

我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	I proposed: When the purchase page is 7c, 8, 9c such a confusing option, the Chinese customer service helped me say that the Japanese common code will not have a c, similar to 140, but do you go to other caterpillar pages to see?	yes
都有美码，日码混标的情况出现。	There are US codes, and the situation of mixed Japanese codes appears.	no

中方客服：我们提供中文服务，但是不知道你要运回国，所以你的运费我们是不予理赔的。	Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese services, but we don't know that you are going to ship back to China, so we will not claim your freight.	no
这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	I don't understand this logic, I'm Japanese, I still have to Chinese customer service, living in Japan in China does not need Chinese customer service, tourists to Japan, without that effort to play international calls, then the question is, who needs to call Amazon overseas purchase Chinese phone, nothing more than like me.	no
亚马逊中文客服不就是方便了我们海淘的这些人吗？	Isn't Amazon Chinese customer service convenient for these people in our Haitao?	no
这次购买不是很满意	This purchase is not very satisfactory	yes

但是这次购买L号的尿布，一箱里面有2包分开包装，打开后就觉得纸张比较松，跟进口帮宝适有明显区别，给宝宝用了之后，还算可以，没有漏尿也没有红疹等迹象。	But this time to buy L diapers, there are 2 packs of separate packaging in a box, after opening it I feel that the paper is relatively loose, and there is a clear difference from imported Pampers, after using it for the baby, it is okay, there is no urine leakage and no rash and other signs.	yes

看来其他牌子的吸管杯把吸管做的倾斜还是有道理的，小孩子的东西，真的就是在乎安全和舒适。	It seems that it makes sense for other brands of straw cups to tilt the straw, children's things, really care about safety and comfort.	yes
轻便大容量	Lightweight and large capacity	yes
喜欢它轻便，开口大，就是两个独立的分隔袋对我来说有点多余，感觉不知道装什么好。	I like that it is light, the opening is large, that is, the two separate divider bags are a bit redundant for me, and I feel like I don't know what to put in it.	yes

然后...就掉坑里了。	And then... Just fell into the pit.	yes
按着这个剧情来说，整本书都是比较轻松愉快的，前部分叶修还在网游里的时候，即使是公会之间勾心斗角，也因为往往被叶神狗血，搞得一点也不沉重。	According to this plot, the whole book is relatively relaxed and pleasant, and when Ye Xiu was still in the online game in the first part, even if it was intrigue between guilds, it was not heavy at all because it was often blooded by Ye Shen.	yes

看整部书花了我高二许多学习时间，可是就是停不下来。	Reading the whole book took me a lot of study time in my sophomore year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.	yes
全职对人物和感情线的描写让人十分惊艳，有的人物只是偶尔带过，也会给人留下很深的影响，像比较重点描写的角色叶修黄少天苏沐橙都有大量的粉丝，而不在写作中心的角色例如江波涛楚云秀等等也十分找人喜欢，在一个电竞的爽文中竟然让人找不到一个让人讨厌至极的人物，这是全职在人物描写上的成功。	The full-time description of characters and emotional lines is very amazing, some characters are only occasionally bring, but also leave a deep impact, such as the more focused characters Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian Su Mucheng have a large number of fans, and the characters who are not in the writing center such as Jiang Botao Chu Yunxiu and so on are also very popular, in an e-sports cool article people can't find a very annoying character, which is the success of full-time in character description.	yes

落寞的小狮子	Lonely little lion	yes
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner", but it turned out to be a lot of text!	yes
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	I read it three times before I finished reading this book to children, a little lion who shoots, and a little lion who loves to eat juice gummies.	yes
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	When I saw the plot of a lion eating a hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable, and modern urbanites are a little unacceptable to be eaten by animals.	yes
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	Seeing in the end, this little lion who has succeeded in human society has lost himself, he is no longer a complete lion, nor is he a complete person.	yes
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	In the end, there was only the back of the little lion, and I don't know where he went.	yes

本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	There have been 3 versions of this work, the largest version, like the complete Michelangelo book, is close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; The middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; This edition is the smallest two-volume edition with a book box.	yes
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	Personally, I think it's acceptable, firstly, the price is cheap, and more than 700 pages are divided into two, and it is better to read as a paperback; Second, unlike Michelangelo's complete works, paintings account for the main body, Leonardo da Vinci's black-and-white manuscript accounts for the majority, and for non-art readers with limited budgets, this edition is the most cost-effective for viewing paintings and manuscripts.	yes
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	2. The explanation of the painting part is great, there is composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know if it is printing or book size issues, some shadows are too deep in the county, can't see the details, a little regretful.	yes
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer.	yes
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius, and the latter is too broad and accomplished to describe it as a genius.	yes
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	If you used to only look at the painting and only experience half of Leonardo da Vinci, you would be completely speechless after reading the manuscript.	yes
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Garbage, who buys who regrets!	yes
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	Never give a bad review, this really heartfelt garbage, bought a waste of money Shenma, give a reason!	yes

发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	The delivery speed is quite fast, here to complain about the courier brother, the valuables are placed in the concierge, walking fast, I can't open the box in front of him for inspection, I am really speechless about this.	yes

目前我有几点感想	At the moment, I have a few thoughts	yes
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	1. The issue of price is not the most important, the key is how to replace the blank book on the Kindle with a book with actual content, instead of downloading it forever is "stay tuned"	yes
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	2. The pre-ordered book should not be bought again in the future, after all, in case of skipping the ticket, and then downloading a book with empty content, the procedure looks very complicated;	yes
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	3. I hope that Amazon will give a normal channel that can feedback such problems, and when there are doubts about the download or use of e-books, there can be local feedback (work orders, online customer service can be, you can refer to how the Microsoft official store does)	yes
不是很推荐阅读	Not very recommended reading	yes
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it from memory to write some feelings after reading.	yes
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	This book is not so much a collection of short stories as a collection of fragments about love in life.	yes
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The tone of this book is extremely bland, it is as bland as boiled water, the pursuit of simplicity is extreme, and the plot is like the street on a summer afternoon, silent and dull.	yes
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Each short story is a silhouette of a short period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no ending.	yes
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	Finally, collected together, titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love".	yes
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I think that this collection of novels, and its title, is like a kind of performance art, the author wants to express that love is not only the joy and sorrow on the stage, the sea dry stone rotten in urban legends, not only you non my non like glue, love is not only the above and should not be represented by the above, love is also a dull life, boring day after day, there is also a helplessness of life, escape from reality, and the dazedness of the future.	yes
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	When reading this book, you may recall the arguing couples around you, the boring marriages of people you know, and unsatisfactory relationships.	yes
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	That's why I don't recommend reading, aesthetically speaking, the writing and plot of this book are boring, unless your life is stormy or sweet as living in a candy castle, you have to read it with the feeling of being strange and boring.	yes
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	And in terms of depth of thought, the daily plot does not make people shine or expand a person's thinking and vision (this is different from Márquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the short fragments do not explore any questions, such as what kind of mistakes caused the failure of love?	yes
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?	no
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much sense to read it or not.	no
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and genre than through the storyline, which is also the reason for the poor reading experience of this book.	no
适合粗读,不能细看。	Suitable for rough reading, not close reading.	yes
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	The logic of this book is good, but the content is not fleshed out.	yes
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	Many sales theories explain what and why, but are weak in how to do it, only pointing the direction but not giving specific practices.	yes
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	Plus, the book feels like a patchwork.	yes
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	Examples include both domestic and foreign ones; There are both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and obscure people.	yes
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	I don't know if the story was compiled for example, but it would be more convincing to cite some cases experienced by the author.	yes
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	Change in terms of customer or customer title.	yes
标题上还是顾客,正文中就变成客户了。	If you still have a customer in the title, you will become a customer in the text.	yes
电子书中还出现了错别字、标点符号缺失、编号错误的问题。	There were also typos, missing punctuation, and misnumbering in the eBook.	yes
总之,这本书作为理论入门是个不错的选择,但对于已经从事销售工作想要提高销售水平的人就不太适用了。	In short, this book is a good choice as a theoretical introduction, but it is not suitable for people who are already working in sales and want to improve their sales level.	yes
快速了解互联网金融的导读书	A quick guide to Internet finance	yes
这本书很浅，可以说只是一个入门课，可以帮助大家快速了解互联网金融的全貌，但要深入了解，还是要按图索骥，自己去深挖。	This book is very shallow, it can be said that it is only an introductory course, which can help everyone quickly understand the full picture of Internet finance, but to understand it in depth, you still have to dig deep according to the diagram.	yes
且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	And the book was written earlier, and the content of the later Alipay WeChat subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned, and today's third-party payment share is only afraid that the proportion is not so small as stated in the book.	yes
现在好多人外出吃饭都是带个手机就好，商家也因为银行流水太高的原因，弃用银联了。	Now many people go out to eat with a mobile phone, and merchants have abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank flow.	yes
但还是非常感谢作者写出这本入门书，看得出作者起码有多年的金融观察经验，对国内外的金融发展史都十分熟悉，所以才能写成如此通俗易懂的内容。	But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this primer book, it can be seen that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience, and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.	yes
写高大空很容易，难的是写的通俗易懂。	It's easy to write tall and empty, but it's hard to write in an easy-to-understand way.	yes
欣赏你，更想让你知道！	Appreciate you and want you to know!	yes
决定一个人工作满意度的第一要素不是薪水高低，而是在工作中是否得到了足够重视和赏识。	The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they are valued and appreciated enough at work.	yes
根据马斯洛需求层次理论，在人的基本生存需要得到满足后，最迫切的就是心理需要的满足——希望被理解、被肯定、被赏识。	According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, after the basic survival needs of people have been satisfied, the most urgent thing is the satisfaction of psychological needs—the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.	yes
确实，对于国人来说，大部分是“爱你在心口难开”，即便是怀有爱、感激与赞赏也是默默放在心里不会说出来。	Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them are "love you can't open in your heart", even if you have love, gratitude and appreciation, you will silently put it in your heart and will not say it.	yes
作者在本书中阐述了五种赞赏的语言：肯定的言辞、精心时刻、服务的行为、称心的礼物、身体接触。	In this book, the author expounds five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, careful moments, acts of service, heartfelt gifts, and physical contact.	yes
我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	I think the important thing is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use these five languages from the bottom of your heart to appreciate and be grateful to the people around you, whether it is family, friends or colleagues.	yes
其实越是亲密的人越需要赞赏和感恩，这样我们的生活才会变得更加美好。	In fact, the closer people are, the more they need to appreciate and be grateful, so that our lives will become better.	yes
学会赞赏，企业也能在一定程度上挽留住人才，降低辞职率。	Learn to appreciate, enterprises can also retain talents to a certain extent, reduce the resignation rate.	yes
感谢译者给我们带来了精彩的国外的思想和世界。	Thank you translators for bringing us wonderful ideas and worlds abroad.	yes
由于中西方文化背景等原因，语言之间或多或少会存在差异，如果有机会能看到作者原版相信会收获更多。	Due to Chinese and Western cultural backgrounds and other reasons, there will be more or less differences between languages, and if you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, I believe you will gain more.	yes
再次谢谢作者和译者以及编辑们的辛勤劳动！	Thank you again to the authors and translators and editors for their hard work!	no
疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	If it is suspected to be counterfeit, please review it strictly by Amazon	yes
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, even inferior to roadside stall products, no grammage, no barcode, ten bags of packaging is also loose, not at all the characteristics of qualified products; is the worst shopping experience on Amazon and has requested a return; It's all a matter of quality; Merchants are advised to keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods; Supplement: I bought Xinxiangyin, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 volumes, added a few comparative photos, further verified the falsification of the product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic losses and further unhappiness!	yes
再度期望亚马逊能够一丝不苟，严把商品源头。	Once again, Amazon is expected to be meticulous and strict with the source of goods.	yes
马马虎虎的产品，和期望有差距	So-so products, and expectations are different	yes
优点：	Merit:	yes
1. 大品牌，价格便宜。	1. Big brand, cheap price.	yes
优点2：电机和刀片都是PANASONIC保证的，使用起来也还OK，但是和我期望有差距。	ADVANTAGE 2: THE MOTOR AND BLADE ARE GUARANTEED BY PANASONIC, AND THEY ARE OK TO USE, BUT THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN WHAT I EXPECTED.	yes
缺点：	Shortcoming:	yes
1. 充电没有指示灯，这个最基本你的电源指示都省下了，估计购买300元产品的客户，在松下PANASONIC的眼里，也是施舍，毫无尊重。	1. Charging without indicator lights, this most basic your power indication is saved, it is estimated that customers who buy 300 yuan products, in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC, are also handouts, no respect.	yes
2. 有强烈的异味 充电时候，哪怕仅仅充电10分钟，就可以闻到强烈的塑胶燃烧的那种味道。	2. There is a strong odor When charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of plastic burning.	yes
办公室试用了1天，搞的全屋子都是这种塑胶味道。	The office tried it for 1 day, and the whole house was filled with this plastic smell.	yes
和我之前用过的同价位的飞利浦PHILIPS相比，虽然多了个刀头，但是松下这款产品，质量真是对不起消费者了。	Compared with the Philips Philips Philips at the same price I used before, although there is an extra knife head, the quality of Panasonic's product is really sorry for consumers.	yes
小包装	Small packages	yes
收到快递一看上面写着电商版就知道又掉坑里了，比超市买的小了好些，应该是M，跟商品介绍上面的图片包装不一样，所谓新版吧。	When I received the express delivery, I saw that it said that the e-commerce version was written on it, and I knew that it fell into the pit again, which is smaller than the supermarket bought, it should be M, which is different from the picture packaging on the product introduction, the so-called new version.	yes
三颗星是怪自己马虎没看清楚商品规格，你卖M码电商版我没意见，你货不对版是几个意思？	Three stars is to blame yourself for not seeing the product specifications clearly, you sell the M code e-commerce version I have no opinion, how many meanings do you mean if the goods are not right?	yes
电商套路深，有时间还是去超市买了。	The e-commerce routine is deep, and I still go to the supermarket to buy it when I have time.	yes
就酱紫。	Just sauce purple.	yes
味道不喜欢	I don't like the taste	yes
小孩很不喜欢牙膏的味道，每次都说辣，也许用别的词形容才更贴切，小孩的词库里暂时只有这个词。	Children don't like the taste of toothpaste very much, every time they say spicy, maybe it is more appropriate to describe it with other words, and the child's thesaurus is only this word for the time being.	yes
搞活动时候买的，很便宜，所以也不好意思给差评了，四星吧，不过不会再买了。	I bought it when I was doing activities, it was very cheap, so I was embarrassed to give a bad review, four stars, but I won't buy it again.	yes
正品哟 包装好	Genuine yo Packaged	yes
包装很完整，里面加了充气袋，没有网上评论的只有光秃秃一个产品的样子。	The packaging is complete, with an inflatable bag added inside, and there are no online reviews only the appearance of a bare product.	yes
瓶子外包装上还有一层塑料膜像图片上描述的一样，快递也很快，拍下第二天就来了。	There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle as described in the picture, and the delivery is also very fast, and the next day it will come.	yes
是正品，只是没货了，不知道什么时候再上架。	It's genuine, but it's out of stock, and I don't know when it will be on the shelves again.	yes
糟心的一次购物体验	A terrible shopping experience	yes
黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	The order placed on the black five, the result was not received for a long time, the latter inquiry, the package has already been signed, asked the colleagues around me said that there was no help to sign, quickly contacted the express company, but said that the sender can initiate an inquiry, contacted Amazon customer service, waited for more than ten days, finally figured out that the express was mistakenly voted to others, and several turnovers finally took back the express, the outer packaging has been unpacked, the goods are still complete, and I don't know if it has been used, in short, it's quite bad	yes
错误的配图	Wrong picture	yes
我以为自己能够收到图1这样的耳机，没想到却收到了图2这样的耳机，图物不一致也就算了，耳机左右声音大小不一又是什么意思？	I thought I could receive headphones like Figure 1, but I didn't expect to receive headphones like Figure 2, even if the picture is inconsistent, what does it mean that the sound size on the left and right of the headphones is different?	yes
虽然名称都是一样的，但还是希望大家能够小心注意，另外还请亚马逊负责人及时更换正确的配图，万分感谢。	Although the names are the same, I still hope that everyone can pay careful attention, and also ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct picture in time, thank you very much.	yes
操作系统一般般	The operating system is so-so	yes
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	After a while, the overall picture is okay, I don't feel any difference, that is, this system makes people look tangled, the boot time is obviously a little slow, and it is not possible to set it well, and then the software does not need to comment, the response speed is more general, and the colleague's is not an order of magnitude compared to it.	yes
看评论说很人性化的设计，我没有找到哪里人性化，遥控器这个常用的上下左右，返回键设计的位置实在是不敢恭维。	Look at the comments that the design is very humane, I didn't find where to be humanized, the remote control this commonly used up and down, left and right, the position of the return key design is really not flattering.	yes
所以呢，就当个电视吧，再外加电视盒之类的用吧。	So, let's use it as a TV, plus a TV box or something.	yes
降价太厉害了	The price reduction is too powerful	yes
降价太厉害了，一百多入现在99！	The price reduction is too powerful, more than a hundred into now 99!	yes
在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	I have accumulated a lot of unevaluated orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the evaluation content.	yes
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I use this paragraph to rate, it means that this product has at least 85 points or more.	yes
而比较差的产品，我绝对不会偷懒到复制粘贴评价，这样其他消费者在购买的时候会作为参考，而商家也会因此改进商品质量。	For relatively poor products, I will definitely not be lazy to copy and paste the evaluation, so that other consumers will use it as a reference when buying, and the merchant will improve the quality of the product.	yes
低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	Low price good line, no fever is enough!	yes
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	Such a cheap line, but it should have reached the HDMI certification standard, personally compare these shit things in the second kill domestic Akihabara (the price is twice as expensive), the line body is thick, but also relatively soft, 7 meters transmission without noise, in the future low-price line to look for Base!	yes
东西还可以，但是亚马逊的售后服务真的比其他网站差太多了	Stuff is okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites	yes
下单后发现下错了，但是取消订单已经取消不了，网页联系在线客服一直显示错误链接，联系不上。	After placing an order, it was found that it was wrong, but the cancellation of the order could not be canceled, and the webpage contact online customer service kept showing the wrong link, and could not be contacted.	yes
到货后送货员给我打电话，我说我不要了，想取消订单的没取消成功，派送员就拿回去了，说先给我签收上，让我申请退货。	After the arrival of the goods, the delivery man called me, I said I don't want it, I wanted to cancel the order but the cancellation was not successful, the delivery man took it back, said to sign for me first, let me apply for a return.	yes
申请退货时才告知食品类一旦签收不能退货，没办法打电话给亚马逊客服，也是一样说法，签收不能退货。	When applying for a return, it is told that the food cannot be returned once it is signed, and there is no way to call Amazon customer service, and the same is true, the signature cannot be returned.	yes
我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I have previously bought items that cannot be returned on the policy in Jingdong and Suning, including milk, diapers, etc., and the contact customer service has been refunded, and the taste of Jingdong's diapers after opening is too big to contact customer service to return, and it will not work when you Amazon.	yes
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it?	yes
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	Tell me that either I will accept it myself, or let the delivery man buy it himself, it is not easy for the delivery man to be in the first place, why should I let the family pay for something that is not purchased by myself?	yes

劝大家不要白花钱	Advise everyone not to spend money in vain	yes
首先满怀期待购买，觉得都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧，收到了以后看包装觉得还可以，个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感，吃到嘴里完全没有味道，寡淡无味，咬开来果肉一圈是暗黄色就是坏了那种，好坏参着卖的，能吃的也就不到三分之一，劝大家不要买，也不便宜，质量太差了！	First of all, I look forward to buying, I think the Dole brand should not be bad to where it is, after receiving it, I think the packaging is okay, the size is not bad, but there is a box is basically soft, the appearance is not visible, to feel, eat to the mouth completely tasteless, tasteless, bite open the flesh is dark yellow is bad kind, good and bad ginseng sold, can eat less than one-third, advise everyone not to buy, not cheap, the quality is too poor!	yes
吃一堑长一智，以后再也不在电商买水果了！	Eat a long and wise, and never buy fruit in e-commerce again!	yes
产品防伪标识在哪里	Where is the product security mark	yes
瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的，从外包装袋看，感觉蹂躏的程度让人揪心，毕竟是食物类的包装太简单了，而且还是属于国际购的，还有没看到什么明显的防伪标识标志，开瓶非常轻松，关键是盖内的一层蜂蜜直接从里面冒出来了，有开口几乎是没有什么粘连性，外国产品都是这样的吗？	The bottom corner of the bottle is dented, should have experienced a strong impact to cause, from the outer packaging bag, feel the degree of ravage is heart-wrenching, after all, is the food packaging is too simple, but also belongs to the international purchase, and did not see any obvious anti-counterfeiting logo, opening the bottle is very easy, the key is that a layer of honey in the lid comes out directly from the inside, there is an opening almost no adhesion, foreign products are like this?	yes
生在中国的我有点不理解了。	Born in China, I don't understand a little.	yes
应该是正品吧？	It should be genuine, right?	yes

提货服务有待改进	The pick-up service needs to be improved	yes
我一共买了5份提货券，在提取时，第一次预约提取3份，结果只寄过来2份，经过多方沟通才确认是漏发、答应后需补发；第二次预约，刚好赶上休息日，网站和微信均无提示需要在工作日预约，造成了不必要的恐慌，建议以后改善。	I bought a total of 5 pickup coupons, at the time of pickup, the first appointment to withdraw 3 copies, the result was only sent 2 copies, after multiple communication to confirm that it was missed, after agreeing to reissue; The second appointment, just in time for the rest day, the website and WeChat did not prompt the need to make an appointment on weekdays, causing unnecessary panic, and it is recommended to improve it later.	yes
不错的购物	Nice shopping	yes
东西好评！	Stuff praised!	yes
还是比较相信亚马逊自营的东西，现在海外购以后很方便，从国外买回来物流时间比国内也就多几天，不得不说亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的，比走转运要快很多，所以现在很多东西都在海外购上买。	Still believe in Amazon's own things, now overseas purchase is very convenient, buy from abroad logistics time is a few days longer than domestic, I have to say that Amazon's overseas purchase to domestic customs clearance ability is still very strong, much faster than transshipment, so now many things are bought overseas.	yes
希望国内商品的质量和价格能够更好一些，很多东西都是国内产的，但是出去转一圈买回来比在国内还便宜，希望改进。	I hope that the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, many things are domestically produced, but it is cheaper to go out and buy back than in China, and I hope to improve.	yes
垃圾	litter	yes
看到这样的包裹，试问大家:觉不觉得是路边的垃圾?	Seeing such a package, I would like to ask everyone: Do you think it is garbage on the side of the road?	yes
一个塑料易碎的包装，就用一个塑料袋从所谓的德国发过来，这样的包装是负责的吗?	Is a plastic fragile package sent from the so-called Germany in a plastic bag?	yes
我看这样的包装是装垃圾一样的，购买这个产品，包装及其简陋，没有任何防止破损的措施，就一个简单的塑料袋包装，到手后，包裹完全变形了，里面的物品也有破损。	I see that such packaging is the same as garbage, buying this product, the packaging and its simplicity, without any measures to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, after hand, the package is completely deformed, and the items inside are also damaged.	yes
如果我只是碰到一个这样的，我认了，买了几个都是这样子，找亚马逊客服，客服就说可以退，但运费垫付，然后运费以礼品卡的形式返回给我。	If I just come across one of these, I recognize it, buy a few of them are like this, go to Amazon customer service, the customer service says that it can be refunded, but the freight is paid in advance, and then the freight is returned to me in the form of gift cards.	yes
我试问一下，我用现金支付运费，你们给我返礼品卡，这是要我自己买你们礼品卡就直说啊，还要自己把产品邮寄到德国仓库，这不是买个产品受罪啊!	Let me ask, I pay for the shipping with cash, you give me back the gift card, this is to buy your gift card by myself, just say ah, but also mail the product to the German warehouse by myself, this is not to buy a product to suffer ah!	yes
而我一直跟客服说，出现这样的问题是谁的责任，客服却半句不说是他们的责任，连半句责任都不敢担当，这样的售后服务还有什么保障呢? 一句话:认栽!但我估计我这个评价，亚马逊都不会给公布的机会，直接回删除!	And I have always told customer service, whose responsibility is it for such a problem, but the customer service does not say that it is their responsibility, and even dare not bear half a responsibility, what is the guarantee for such after-sales service? In a word: recognize the plant! But I estimate that my evaluation, Amazon will not give the opportunity to publish, directly delete it!	yes
质量很好5星，物流很差	Good quality 5 stars, poor logistics	yes
1，质量很好，秒杀的，价格适中，物超所值。	1, good quality, second deal, moderate price, excellent value for money.	yes
2，结实、用料足、焊点牢固、表面处理得当、颜色很好。	2, strong, sufficient material, strong solder joint, proper surface treatment, good color.	yes
3，物流是硬伤，3号下的单，11号到的。	3, the logistics is a hard injury, the order placed on the 3rd, the 11th arrived.	yes
4，如果亚马逊没有标注预计到货时间是2月7号，我或许会很满意。	4. If Amazon does not indicate that the expected arrival time is February 7th, I may be very satisfied.	yes
5，但标注了预期到货时间，就相当于给用户一个承诺，当承诺无法兑现的时候，用户很难受。	5, but marking the expected arrival time is equivalent to giving the user a promise, and when the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user is very uncomfortable.	yes
6，如果你没有给予承诺的把握，请不要做出承诺。	6. If you are not sure of giving a promise, please do not make a commitment.	yes
7，实际上，我非常在意商家做出的承诺。	7. Actually, I care a lot about the promises made by merchants.	yes
8，所以，我打了低分。	8, so, I scored low.	yes
金线会掉色	The gold thread will fade	yes
效果还是有的，但感觉是否明显，就看个人咯，或是心理作用。	The effect is still there, but whether it feels obvious depends on the individual, or the psychological effect.	yes
有一点不太好的，就是金色的线，本来设计出来是觉得好看，但实际上，这个金线会掉色，往车上一放，如果拿动几次，手上，和车上，会有一些金粉。	One thing that is not very good is that the golden thread, originally designed to look good, but in fact, this gold thread will fade, put it on the car, if you take it a few times, on the hand, and on the car, there will be some gold dust.	yes
希望产品可以改进。	Hope the product can be improved.	yes
这种方形的，也没啥装饰效果，就不要搞金线上去，掉下来在车上弄脏车还麻烦。	This kind of square one, there is no decorative effect, don't engage in gold wire, fall down on the car to dirty the car is still troublesome.	yes
东西完好，速度可以，分2个包裹还不同包装	The thing is intact, the speed is OK, it is packed in 2 packages and different packages	yes
8天的速度蛮快的，但就是2件分了2个包裹，包装还不一样，明显一个防震太多了，厚纸板贴着，封了层塑料，外包装也方便拆，一个就国内的快递盒似的，放了几个缓冲气囊就算事了，感觉有点敷衍。	The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it is 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, the packaging is not the same, obviously a shockproof is too much, thick cardboard is attached, sealed with a layer of plastic, the outer packaging is also easy to remove, one is like a domestic express box, put a few buffer air bags even if it is a thing, it feels a little perfunctory.	yes

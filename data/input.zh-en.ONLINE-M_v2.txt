.h 预处理器文件; 通常不出现在命令行上其他后级名的文件被传递给连接器 (Linker).通常包括:	.h Preprocessor files; files that do not usually appear on the command line are passed to the connector (Linker).This usually includes:	no
.0 目标文件 (Object file)	.0 Object File (Object File)	no
.a 归档库文件(Archive file)	.a archive file (archive file)	no
除非使用了 -cec，-s, 或 -E 选项(或者编译错误阻止了完整的过程),否则连接总是最后的步骤.	Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process), the connection is always the last step.	no
在连接阶段中,所有对应于源程序的.e 文件，-1 库文件, 无法识别的文件名(包括指定的.o H 标文件和 .a 库文件)按命令行中的顺序传递给连接器选项 (OPTIONS)	At the connection stage, all correspond to the source program.e file, -1 library file, unrecognizable file name (including specified.o H-marked documents and .a library file) is passed to the connector options (OPTIONS) in the order of the command line.	no
选项必须分立给出 : de ' 完全不同于 `-d -r '.	The options must be given separately: de ' is completely different from '-d -r '.	no
大多数 ` -=E :和 `-W' 选项有两个相反的格式 : -fname 和 -fno-name (或 -Wname 和 -Wno- name).	Most '-=E: and '-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).	no
这里只列举不是默认选项的格式.	Only formats that are not the default options are listed here.	no
下面是所有选项的摘要, 按类型分组, 解释放在后面的章节中.	Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, explained in later chapters.	no
代码生成选项 (Code Generation Option)	The Code Generation Option	yes
总体选项 (Overall Option)	General Option (Overall Option)	yes
明确指出后面输入文件的语言为 language (而不是从文件名后绥得到的默认选择).	Make it clear that the language of the next input file is language (not the default selection obtained from the filename).	yes
这个选项应用于后面所有的输入文件, 直到遇着下一个 `-x' 选项 .language 的可选	This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next '-x' option is encountered.Language is optional	yes
关闭任何对语种的明确说明, 因此依据文件名后级处理后面的文件 RE AS E ` -x' 选项).	Turn off any explicit statement of the language, so the RE AS E ' -x' option after the file is processed according to the file name).	yes
如果只操作四个阶段( 预处理, 编译, 汇编, 连接)中的一部分, 可以使用 ` -x' 选项 (或文件名后 Ah) 告诉 geo 从哪里开始,用 `~-c' ，`-s' ,或 `-E' 选项告诉 geo 到哪里结束.注意,某些选项组合 (例如 ，`-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c 编译或汇编源文件, ETER. ERA ATI 缺省情况下， GCC 通过用 ` .o' 蔡换源文件名后级 ` .ec 标文件名. 可以使用-o 选项选择其他名字.GCC忽略 -ec 选项后面任何无法识别的输入文伯 -S F 何事情.	If only a portion of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, connecting) are operated, you can use the '-x' option (or Ah after the filename) to tell geo where to start, and the '~-c', '-s', or '-E' option to tell geo where to end.Note that certain combinations of options (e.g., '-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble the source file, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC uses ' .o 'Change source file name back level ' .EC Name of the document. You can use the -o option to select other names.GCC ignores any unrecognizable input after the -ec option.	yes
了的目标文件.	The target document.	yes
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	Stop after compilation, do not compile.	yes
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	Work between different stages of the compilation process using pipelines rather than temporary files, because the compilers of those systems cannot read data from pipelines, and the GNU compiler does not have this problem, the compiler can accept the C "dialect": support for ANSI compliant C programs.	yes
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This will disable some feature keywords in GNU Cc that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, such as unix and vax, which indicate that the ANSI trigraph feature is rarely used, and disable all standard libraries available in a hosted environment, and the main function returns an int value, typically for almost all programs except the kernel.The corresponding independent environment (f£reestanding environment) does not have a standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example being the operating system kernel.See the latest information on the GCC website.	yes
对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	For function declarations without parameters, such as 'int foo();', are handled in the C style - i.e. without specifying the number or type of parameters. (Only for C++).	no
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	Normally, such a function foo means in C++ that the argument is empty.	no
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	The section list is removed from here to try to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.	no
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	See the NU c manual for details, and we have removed the details so that when the content is outdated, people will not HERI.	no
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	Except for one thing: For C++ programs (not C), the ' -traditional' option has an additional effect that allows this to be assigned.	no
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	It is the same as the '-Ethis-is-variable' option.	no
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp tries to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.	no
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	In particular, the preprocessor is mentioned above, but not the other effects of the '-traditional' option.	no
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	-fdollars-in-identifiers Allows the use of the '$' character in the identifier (for C++ only).	no
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	You can specify the '-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to indicate that the '$' character is not used.	no
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	(GNU C++ allows the '$' character by default on some target systems, but not on all systems.))	no
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of ant type to enumeration (MEF c++).	no
正常情况下 GNU C++ 允许从 enum 到 int 的转换,反之则不行.	Under normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows conversions from enum to int, but not vice versa.	no
-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	-fexternal--templates generates smaller code (only in C++) for the template declaration by generating a copy of each template function only where they are defined.	no
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	To use this option successfully, you must mark '#pragma implementatio' (definition) or '#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use the template.	no
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	When the program is compiled with '-fexternal-templates ', the template instantiation is of an external type.You have to make the required instances appear in the implementation file.	no
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	This can be done by typedef, which references every instance needed.	no
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	Correspondingly, if you use the default option '-fno-exteznal-templates' when compiling, all template instances are explicitly set to be built-in.	no
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All member functions (except the constructor subfunctions and the mnew or delete member operators) are treated as virtual functions of their class.	no
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	This does not mean that every call to the member function will go through the internal virtual function table.	no
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it is called directly.	no
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch Allows the types of the second and third parameters of the conditional expression to mismatch.	no
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	The value of this expression is void.-fthis-—is-variable Allows assignment to this (only for C++).	no
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	Merging user-defined free storage management mechanisms into C++ makes the assignable 'this' look out of date.	no
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	Therefore, by default, the assignment of this within the class member function is invalid.	no
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	However, for backwards compatibility, you can make this work with the '-fthis-is-variable' option.	no
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	-funsigned-char Defines char as an unsigned type, just like unsigned char.	no
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Each machine has its own default char type. It can be either an unsigned char or a signed char.	no
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	Ideally, when relying on the symbolic nature of the data, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz.	no
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	But many programs have been written with only simple char, and the period street is a symbolic number (or unsymbolic number, depending on the target machine that wrote the program).	no
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This option, and its antithesis, makes such a program work at the corresponding default value.	no
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly the same as one of them.	no
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	If the 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifier is not explicitly declared, these options are used to define a bitfield or unsigned bitfield.	no
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	By default, bitfields are symbolic because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are symbolic, however, if the '-traditional' option is specified, bitfields are always unsigned.	no
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	-fwritable-strings stores string constants into writable data segments without special treatment.	no
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	This is to be compatible with some older programs, where changing string constants is a very bad idea, and the '-traditional' option has the same effect.	no

在过去二十年期间，发展中国家吸毒情况的增长速度远远快于发达国家。	Over the past two decades, drug abuse in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.	no
这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。	This partly reflects the difference in overall population growth over the period, 7 per cent in developed countries and 28 per cent in developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth of the younger population in developing countries.	no
青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。	Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.	no
在2000-2018年期间，发展中国家这一年龄段的人口增长了16%,而发达国家这一年龄段的人口减少了10%。	During the period 2000-2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16 per cent, while that of developed countries decreased by 10 per cent.	no
1城市化是当前和未来毒品市场的一个驱动因素	Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets	no
无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。	In both developed and developing countries, drug use is higher in urban areas than in rural areas.	no
吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。	The overall increase in drug use is due in part to large-scale rural-urban migration. More than half of the world ' s population now lives in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.	no
城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。	Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, particularly in developing countries where urbanization is more pronounced.	no
财富的增加与吸毒情况增多相联，但承受疾病负担最大的是最贫穷的人在世界范围内，发达国家的吸毒情况比发展中国家更为普遍。	Increased wealth was associated with increased drug use, but the burden of disease was borne by the poorest of the world ' s population, and drug use was more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.	no

这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。	These patterns appear to be less common among the more affluent social classes.	no
全球新冠肺炎危机造成的经济制约很可能会加剧包括吸毒者在内的最弱势群体的风险。	The economic constraints imposed by the global new coronavirus crisis are likely to exacerbate the risk of the most vulnerable, including drug users.	no
例如，劳动力市场的变化，如失业率上升，过去一直与吸毒情况的增加有关，而这场疫情己经迫使全球数千万人失业。	For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have in the past been linked to increased drug use, an epidemic that has forced tens of millions of people out of work around the world.	no
新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。	The coronavirus pandemic, which could lead to further expansion of the drug market, could lead to more farmers or to illicit crop cultivation, either because the control capacity of national authorities is weakened, or because more people may have to risk their lives and engage in illicit activities during an economic crisis.	no
新冠肺炎的相关限制措施导致空中和陆路交通减少，海上贩运可能已经因此而增加，海上的拦截风险低，而且比空中或陆路走私的数量更多。	Restrictions related to New Coronavirus have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, which may have increased maritime trafficking, with a low risk of interception at sea and a higher volume than air or land smuggling.	no
最近已有报告称可卡因货物直接从南美经由海路运往欧洲。	There have been recent reports of cocaine shipments directly from South America to Europe by sea.	no
复杂性增强	Increased complexity	yes
非国际管制物质的出现情况稳定，但有潜在危害的新型类阿片正在增多毒品市场正日趋复杂。	The availability of non-internationally controlled substances was stable, but new types of potentially harmful opioids were proliferating and the drug market was becoming increasingly complex.	yes
除大麻、可卡因和海洛因等植物类物质之外，已经增添了数百种合成毒品，其中许多并不在国际管制之下。药品的非医疗使用也快速增多。	In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control.Non-medical use of drugs is also increasing rapidly.	yes
会员国的国内市场每年约有500种新型活性物质。	Approximately 500 new active substances are available on the domestic market of Member States each year.	yes
目前其中大多是兴奋剂，其次是合成的大麻素受体激动剂和少量的类阿片。	Currently, most of these are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and small amounts of opioids.	yes

2新型精神活性物质的使用可能会逐渐牢固存在于弱势群体中	The use of new psychoactive substances may become entrenched in vulnerable groups	no
单一种类的新型精神活性物质几乎从未形成大的市场。	New psychoactive substances of a single class have almost never formed a large market.	no
但来自欧洲的证据表明，合成大麻素在无家可归者和监狱囚犯等社会边缘群体中是一个严重的问题。	But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.	no
有22个国家报告了监狱中使用新型精神活性物质的情况，其中大多数国家将合成大麻素确定为主要挑战。	Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, most of which identified synthetic cannabinoid as a major challenge.	no
对前体化学品的管制迫使制毒者进行创新最常作为前体用来合成苯丙胺、甲基苯丙胺和“摇头丸”等毒品的许多化学品已被置于国际管制之下。	The control of precursor chemicals has forced drug makers to innovate. Many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamines, methamphetamines and “ecstasy” have been placed under international control.	no
贩毒者和制毒者一直在寻找替代品一不仅有管制较松的物质，还有专门为规避管制而设计的化学品，即所谓的“特制前体”。	Drug traffickers and producers have been looking for alternatives not only to less regulated substances, but also to chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, known as “specialized precursors”.	no
旨在阻止新冠肺炎传播的限制性措施很可能使依赖前体化学品的制毒者受到进一步挤压。	Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of new coronavirus are likely to further squeeze drug makers who rely on precursor chemicals.	no
来自墨西哥的证据表明，这已经成为 现实：据报告，2020年3月，从东亚进口的甲基苯丙胺前体短缺促使墨西哥和美国的甲基苯丙胺价格上涨。	Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia was reported to have driven up methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States in March 2020.	no
市场瞬息万变	The market is rapidly changing.	no
合成药物在中亚和俄罗斯联邦取代阿片剂	Synthetic Drugs Replace Opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation	no

加拿大、乌拉圭和美国的11个法域允许制造大麻产品供非医疗使用。	Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.	yes
在其中多数法域，大麻使用自合法化以来有所增多，尽管在其他未将非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域也观察到了同样的趋势。	In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized the non-medical use of cannabis.	yes
在美国最早通过立法的两个州科罗拉多州和华盛顿州，成年人非医疗使用大麻的情况增加，特别是过去一个月以及每天或几乎每天使用的情况增多，自2012年起便已超过了全国平均水平。	In Colorado and Washington, the two first U.S. states to pass legislation, non-medical marijuana use among adults has increased, especially in the past month and daily or almost daily use, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.	yes

全球大麻药草缉获量暴跌的背后原因是大麻合法化？	The reason behind the plunge in global cannabis herb seizures is the legalization of cannabis.	yes
2018年，全球大麻药草缉获量降至20年来的最低水平，这是因为北美的缉获量下降，在过去10年中下降了 84%。	In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, as seizures in North America declined by 84% over the past 10 years.	no
相比之下，同期世界其他地区的缉获量几乎翻了一番。缉获的模式表明，旨在放开大麻市场的政策在下降中发挥了关键作用。	In contrast, seizures in the rest of the world almost doubled during the same period.The pattern of seizures shows that policies aimed at opening up the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.	no
对新型精神活性物质的监管似乎有遏制作用在国内对新型精神活性物质的监管效果仍然很难评估。	The regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect, and the regulatory effect of new psychoactive substances at home is still difficult to assess.	no

贫困、有限的教育和社会边缘化可能会增加吸毒病症风险，并加剧其后果。高收入国家的研宄证实了这一点，在这些研究中，个人不利的社会经济轨迹一不仅仅是他们在某一时间点的状况一也与吸毒病症风险有关。	Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorders and exacerbate their consequences.This is confirmed by studies in high-income countries, where the adverse socioeconomic trajectory of individuals is linked not only to their condition at a certain point in time, but also to the risk of drug use.	no
吸毒病症还会加深社会经济劣势，进一步增加失业、贫困和无家可归的风险，从而助长劣势的恶性循环。这些结果也可能与刑事司法系统内的侮辱性态度和后果有关。	Drug use also deepens socio-economic disadvantage and further increases the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thus fuelling a vicious cycle of disadvantage.These results may also be related to insulting attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.	no

但在暴力事件中，酒精的作用似乎比毒品更大。	But in violence, alcohol seems to play a bigger role than drugs.	no
虽然吸毒可能会导致犯罪，但在某些情况下，这种联系可以部分归因于多种中介因素，如社会经济劣势以及由个人风险、家庭环境和同龄人影响造成的其他类型的逆境。	While drug use can lead to crime, in some cases this link can be partly attributed to multiple mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantages and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment and peer influence.	no
贩毒和暴力之间的联系是多方面的。	The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.	no
如果已有稳定的犯罪结构，包括国际贩毒在内的大规模有组织犯罪活动有可能在无暴力的情况下实施。	Large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, is likely to be carried out without violence if a stable criminal structure is in place.	no
短期内，暴力的存在和程度与其说取决于贩运的数量，不如说取决于造成有组织犯罪集团之间力量平衡不稳定的某些变化，例如非法市场规模的变化，知名罪犯的死亡或监禁，以及使一个集团弱于另一个集团的执法措施。	In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depend less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that create a destabilizing balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group than another.	no
最新趋势	The Latest Trends	yes
吸毒大麻是最常用的物质，类阿片危害最大	Drug-using marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most harmful.	yes
据估计，2018年使用大麻的有 1.92 亿人，使之成为全球使用最多的毒品。	An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug in the world.	yes
相比之下，2018年使用类阿片的有5,800万人。	By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.	yes
但阿片类药物的相关危害却因使用者较少而受到忽视。	But the associated hazards of opioids are overlooked because of the low number of users.	yes
在2017年与吸毒病症有关的估计167,000例死亡中，有66%是这类物质造成的，在据信为吸毒导致的残疾或过早死亡而损失的2,100万年寿命中，有50%是这类物质造成的。	Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66 per cent were caused by such substances, and 50 per cent of the 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death due to drug use were caused by such substances.	yes
合成类阿片的非医疗使用加剧了公共卫生危机	Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis	yes
在西非、中部非洲和北非，加剧类阿片危机的是曲马多；在北美则是芬太尼。这两个区域在经济、人口统计数据或一般吸毒模式方面几乎没有共同点，但都在奋力抗击由容易获得且生产成本低的物质助长的类阿片危机。	In West, Central and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by tramadol; in North America, fentanyl.The two regions have little in common in terms of economics, demographics or general patterns of drug use, but both are struggling to fight the opioid crisis fuelled by substances that are readily available and cheap to produce.	yes
在北美，芬太尼等合成类阿片的使用导致了20年来类阿片过量致死人数增加。	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.	yes
2018年，在美国登记的67,367例过量死亡中，有三分之二涉及芬太尼。	In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the U.S. involved fentanyl.	yes
加拿大也报告了类似的结果，只是数字较低。	Canada reported similar results, but with lower numbers.	no
芬太尼导致过量死亡的部分原因是非法药物市场上的芬太尼药效不可预测。	Part of the reason for fentanyl overdose deaths is the unpredictable efficacy of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.	no
在西非、中部非洲和北非，非医疗用途曲马多的市场已有大幅增长。	In West, Central and North Africa, the market for non-medical use tramadol has grown significantly.	no
在该区域，接受治疗的曲马多使用病症患者越来越多。	In the region, more and more patients with the condition are being treated with tramadol.	no
2017年，全球截获的曲马多数量显著增加，达到125吨以上的峰值。	In 2017, the global majority of trampolines intercepted increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.	no
但2018年，在印度通过一项监管曲马多的新法律之后，全球缉获量降至32吨。	But in 2018, global seizures fell to 32 tons after India passed a new law regulating tramadol.	no
促成这两地危机的是制造简单和生产成本低，此外还有对曲马多和许多芬太尼类似物或其前体缺乏国际监管。	Simplicity of manufacture and low cost of production, coupled with a lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors, contributed to both crises.	no
使这两地危机恶化的是这些物质在药品市场和非法市场上都有供应，因而更加难以发现和防止其滥用。	The crises in both regions are exacerbated by the fact that these substances are available on both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making them more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.	no
兴奋剂使用不断增多	Increasing use of stimulants	no
兴奋剂领域以可卡因和甲基苯丙胺为主，这两种物质在其主要市场的使用量都在上升。	The doping sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in their main markets.	no
2018年使用可卡因的约有1,900万人，因为可卡因在北美和西欧颇为流行。	About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018 because of its popularity in North America and Western Europe.	no
同年使用苯丙胺的约有2,700万人，其中甲基苯丙胺是东南亚和北美使用最多的苯丙胺类兴奋剂。	Approximately 27 million people used amphetamine in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most widely used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.	no
根据所掌握的多数指标，20年来这两个区域甲基苯丙胺的使用一直在扩大。	According to most indicators available, the use of methamphetamine has been increasing in both regions over the past 20 years.	no
在一些市场上，可卡因和甲基苯丙胺可以共存，有时是相互替代，这样一种药物的使用量上升时另一种药物的使用量就下降，有时是同时增加和减少以满足同一市场的需求。	In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting each other, with the use of one drug increasing and the use of another decreasing, sometimes increasing and decreasing simultaneously to meet the needs of the same market.	no
新冠肺炎使注射吸毒者的风险增高	New Crown Pneumonia Increases Risk for Injecting Drug Users	no
据估计，2018年注射吸毒的约有1,130万人，全球艾滋病毒感染约有10%是注射吸毒造成的。	It is estimated that about 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018, and about 10 per cent of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drug use.	no
注射吸毒者感染艾滋病毒的超过100万人，患丙型肝炎的有550万人。	More than 1 million people who inject drugs are infected with HIV and 5.5 million people have hepatitis C.	no
2017年，因吸毒死亡的约有 58.5万人，其中一半死于丙型肝炎引起的肝病，而注射吸毒者的丙型肝炎大多仍未得到治疗。	About 585,000 people died from drug use in 2017, half of them from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and hepatitis C among injecting drug users remains largely untreated.	no
5 新冠肺炎限制措施造成的类阿片短缺可能导致使用者代之以酒精或苯二氮类药物等更容易获得的物质，或者将类阿片与合成药物混合。	Opioid shortages caused by new coronavirus restrictions may result in users switching to more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or mixing opioids with synthetic drugs.	no
随着一些使用者改用注射或更频繁地注射，可能会出现更多有害的使用方式。	As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful uses may emerge.	no

欧盟峰会为难民政策争论，欧盟官员：接收过程步步瓶颈-中新网	EU summit for refugee policy debate, EU officials: reception process step by step bottlenecks	yes
欧盟峰会为难民政策争吵不休，欧盟官员：接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈	EU summit bickering over refugee policy, EU officials: bottlenecks at every step of the reception process	yes
【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	At the latest EU summit on the day, European Commission President von der Leyen said EU leaders had agreed to a stricter policy on illegal immigration to make it easier to deport illegal migrants.	yes
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	The move is reportedly a response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, where the core problem is the small number of illegal migrants who can ultimately be repatriated.	yes
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to “immediately mobilise substantial EU funds” to strengthen the external borders, including by means of infrastructure and surveillance.	yes
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	However, the EU and member states have been arguing over issues such as the payment of fencing costs.	yes
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not cover the costs.	yes
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	But diplomats from some member states say that if the EU were to share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along its external borders, it would free up national budgets to speed up the construction process.	yes
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	EU officials have acknowledged bottlenecks at every step of the process, limited reception capacity and overburdened immigration authorities in member states to prevent refugees from submitting “numerous” asylum applications in EU countries, and the EU’s refugee reception system is in a near-permanent crisis.	yes
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	The European Commission estimates that the EU’s Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, almost half the year before.	yes
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	At the same time, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.	no
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	The summit also agreed on a “principle” according to which EU countries can return illegal migrants on the basis of a court decision of another member state.	no
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	EU leaders also agreed to “increase the use of the concept of safe states,” which would pave the way for the EU to develop a common list.	no

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	U.S. upgrades "chip war" to severely hit the global semiconductor industry	yes
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	Recently, the U.S. against China "chip war" has escalated - first, the Netherlands and Japan under pressure from the United States, agreed to start the control of exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; then foreign media reports, the U.S. government is considering cutting off all ties between U.S. suppliers and Huawei companies, prohibiting U.S. suppliers to provide any product to Huawei; the Biden government is also preparing to release an executive order to limit U.S. investment in sensitive Chinese technology industry...	yes
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	In recent years, the United States has never stopped fighting China's "core" development action, while precisely suppressing China's semiconductor production supply chain, while building a "de-Chinese" semiconductor industry chain alliance, and trying to completely "dump" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.	yes
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it is to attract South Korea to establish a "technical alliance", or establish a chip "quartet alliance" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan region of China, or establish a semiconductor industry chain "small circle" through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-Australia "Quartet Mechanism" "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework", the United States through the politicization, campaigning, weaponization means to introduce the semiconductor industry, trying to build a closed production supply chain cycle led by the United States, so as to make up its shortcomings in the chip manufacturing field and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.	yes
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	However, the much-vaunted "core tactic" of the United States against China is also "harm the enemy a thousand self-damage eight hundred."	yes
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	Recently, Pan Lin Group, a well-known US chip manufacturing equipment supplier, announced that affected by the latest round of ban on the export of chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.	yes
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	Global lithography giant Dutch Asma Holdings recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.	yes
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	After the U.S. government's brutal crackdown on China's chip and semiconductor industries, many U.S. companies have suffered, including developers of electronic design automation tools, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, and so on.	yes
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	The United States so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry, but dragged the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain down the water.	yes
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has long formed a closely related global semiconductor industry chain.	yes
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	According to professional estimates, based on the specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross national borders more than 70 times, reaching 100 days.	no
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Although the U.S. semiconductor industry has a strong base, it is weak in manufacturing capacity, especially in advanced process processes, and relies heavily on the East Asian region.	no
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	Even if the United States vigorously guides the advanced chip production supply chain to the US-led "small circle" regional development, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries are difficult to change.	no
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The United States has vigorously "restructured" and "de-Chinaization" semiconductor industry chain, which has severely affected the global semiconductor industry.	no
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	Chip is the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the joint participation of countries around the world.	no
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introducing the Innovation and Competition Act, the 2022 United States Competition Act, and the Chip and Science Act, using scientific and technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership; "Enwei" to its allies, luring chip manufacturing enterprises such as Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other to set up factories in the United States, and striving to ensure the global leadership of the United States in the chip field.	no
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	In the short term, the United States has indeed created problems for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and has reaped real benefits.	no
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	But in the long run, the United States hysterically suppressed, but forced China's chip industry to continue to break through, let itself lose the huge Chinese market, ultimately greatly weakening the innovation willingness and innovation ability of U.S. science and technology enterprises, harming the development of the global chip industry.	no

近日，知名健身机构中健健身会员维权问题引起社会关注。	Recently, the issue of defending the rights of fitness members in well-known fitness institutions has caused social concern.	yes
春节后不少会员发现自己所在门店没有正常营业，随后，关于该机构倒闭跑路的传闻引起会员恐慌，导致公安、人社部门介入。	After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally, and subsequently, rumors about the institution's failure and closure caused panic among members, leading to public security, human and social departments to intervene.	yes
最后，该机构相关负责人出面回应，承诺会努力保障好员工和会员的合法权益，风波才得以平息。	Finally, the relevant person in charge of the institution responded, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm was quelled.	yes
个别健身机构的部分门店出现经营问题，暂时关闭，消费者本可心平气和等待问题解决，为何不少会员的第一反应是“大事不妙”？	Some of the stores of individual fitness institutions have operating problems, temporarily closed, consumers can calmly and wait for the problem to be solved, why many members of the first reaction is "big things are bad"?	yes
健身俱乐部会员维权风波背后，是行业信任危机的深层次问题。	Behind the turmoil of fitness club members is the deep problem of the crisis of trust in the industry.	yes
国内传统健身房普遍采取预付费模式，“赚用户不来的钱”是其发展的底层逻辑。	Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt the prepaid model, "earning money that users do not come" is the underlying logic of its development.	yes
通过预售会员卡获取现金流，不断开新店，看似能够循环往复，实则寅吃卯粮，无法形成稳定的盈利模式。	Through the pre-sale of membership cards to obtain cash flow, keep opening new stores, seemingly able to cycle back and forth, in fact, to eat bread, can not form a stable profit model.	yes
健身房跑路等行业负面信息频频传出，对消费者信心造成强烈冲击。	Negative information in the industry such as gym running often comes out, causing a strong impact on consumer confidence.	yes
从市场前景看，健身房当然算得上是一门有“钱途”的好生意。	From the perspective of the market, the gym is of course a good business with "money way".	no

相比大建新店抢占市场，健身行业当前更需要的是沉下心来优化服务，用高质量发展来稳住用户。	Compared with the new store to seize the market, the current need for the fitness industry is to sink the heart to optimize services, with high-quality development to stabilize users.	no

同时，身体数据、运动数据得以有效利用，还可以满足社交需求，实现从线上到线下完整的服务闭环。	At the same time, physical data and movement data can be effectively utilized, but also can meet social needs and realize complete closed-loop services from online to offline.	no
没有私教推销，没有巨额年卡，用户对健身机构“跑路”的担忧降低了，信任感也就提升了。	Without private education promotion, without a huge annual card, users' worries about the "runway" of fitness institutions are reduced, and the sense of trust is improved.	no
另外，还要积极探索多元业态。	It is also important to actively explore diversity.	no
如今，体育消费已经从单一服务走向场景消费，健身俱乐部有望成为消费新入口，围绕健身所需的运动补给和健身器械等周边产品或将成为新的盈利点，为消费者提供更丰富选择。	Today, sports consumption has gone from a single service to scene consumption, fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption, around the sports supplies and fitness equipment needed for fitness or will become a new profit point, providing consumers with a richer choice.	no

孙先生表示，置业顾问表示这其实就是一份“保价协议”，目的是让买家放心出手，不用担心开发企业降价促销，“现在就怕买完了它就降价了，去售楼处闹吧没时间，不闹的话也确实窝心”。	Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually a "price guarantee agreement", the purpose is to let buyers rest assured, do not worry about the development of the enterprise price reduction promotion, "now afraid to buy it will reduce the price, go to the sale of the building no time, do not worry, do not worry".	yes

他认为如今开发企业比买房人更需要信心，推出“保价协议”其实也是在给其打气。	He believes that today’s development companies need more confidence than buying houses, and the launch of the “price guarantee agreement” is actually giving it a boost.	no
至于能否留住买房人，他表示这取决于调控政策、贷款门槛等多重因素的影响，就目前来看仍有待观察。	As for whether to keep buyers, he said it depends on the influence of multiple factors such as regulatory policies, loan thresholds and other, for now it remains to be seen.	no

重阳问答︱如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Chongyang Q&A – How to view the U.S. nonfarm employment data in January broadly exceeded expectations and future trends - Economic Watch Network - Professional Financial News Website	yes
Q：请问重阳投资，如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势？	Q: How does the U.S. non-farm employment data for January greatly exceed expectations and future trends?	yes
A：2月3日美国劳工部公布2023年1月非农就业数据，新增非农就业51.7万人，大幅高于市场预期的18.9万人；失业率降至3.4%，为近50年以来的最低位；时薪同比增速4.4%，环比增速0.3%，略有放缓。	A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released non-farm employment data in January 2023, adding 517,000 new non-farm employment, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000 people; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; hourly wage growth rate of 4.4%, the growth rate of 0.3%, slowing slightly.	yes
从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	From the total point of view, there are many one-time and technical factors disturbances in this data, such as the teachers who went on strike, the correction of the survey statistical caliber, the update of the seasonal factor, and the subsequent correction may be made (referring to the new non-farmers reduced from 504,000 to 364,000 people in January 2022), non-farm employment or not as strong as the data reflect.	yes
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	From a structural point of view, the impact of job cuts in high-tech enterprises is still low; new employment in high-contact services such as leisure hotels, education and health care has rebounded sharply, and data show that the service labor gap remains.	yes
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Combined with the equally well-expected services PMI, a rebound in job vacancy and labor gap data, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the U.S. service sector has ushered in a rapid recovery after extreme weather and the holidays.	yes
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	We believe that supply-demand tensions in the U.S. job market are unlikely to improve without a recession.	yes
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	At present, the U.S. labor market still has a supply gap of more than 5 million, and the labor participation rate is slowly rising, especially the labor participation rate between the ages of 25-54 has reached its pre-epidemic high.	yes
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	In addition, strong consumer demand, due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit, will push the impact of austerity policies on the job market to lag further.	yes
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	Continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be the backdrop for the U.S. economy in 2023.	yes
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	The overlap is now nearing the end of the rate hike, inflation expectations are repeated, and we are not optimistic about a continued decline in wage growth.	no
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Prior to the release of this data, the U.S. equity bond exchange market was too optimistic about the Fed’s rate hike path.	no
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	With the continued improvement of inflation data, the Fed has kept the market inflation expectations fragile while shortening the pace of rate hikes, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed’s hawkish expression, not only expecting to stop hikes early, but also expecting two rate cuts at the end of the year.	no
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	Given tight supply and demand in the labor market and uncertainty about the impact of austerity policy, we believe that the Fed’s guidance on rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and that extreme market expectations of adjustments and trading overcrowding are likely to hurt the market.	no
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	Nevertheless, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with the M2 data year-on-year and the gradual improvement of the CPI sub-heading indicators, since October the U.S. CPI data has turned to a rapid decline stage, the stubbornness of wage growth will only form the bottom of the future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, in the next inflation data release market or enter a new round of game.	no

就在服装业务如日中天时，杉杉集团却开始转型，因为郑永刚意识到 ， “ 一旦市场放开，中国品牌自然会形成一个梯队式品牌市场，杉杉西服想一直独领风骚，长期成为国人的国服的可能性不大 ” 。	Just in the clothing business day by day, Sugi Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized, "Once the market is opened, Chinese brands will naturally form a echelons of brand market, Sugi western clothing want to always lead the way, long-term national uniform is unlikely."	yes

郑永刚曾分享过投后管理的心得 ， “ 中国的民营企业收购国际上的一些高科技企业，成功概率比较低，为什么那些收购会失败？	Zheng Yonggang once shared the post-investment management experience, "China's private enterprises acquire some international high-tech enterprises, the probability of success is relatively low, why those acquisitions will fail?	no
因为大家都会去考虑，我花了那么多钱，我得去派人管对吧，这是通常会做的一个行为 ” ， 然而郑永刚则不同，杉杉收购成功的那一天，郑永刚就到杉金光电当众宣布，杉杉作为杉金的大股东，决定实施一企两制，除了郑永刚担任董事长，杉杉企业的人不派到杉金，采取授权经营的方式，原有的分配制度、企业文化、各项管理等模式不变。	Because everyone will consider, I spent so much money, I have to send people right, this is usually an act to do, "However, Zheng Yonggang is different, the day of the successful acquisition, Zheng Yonggang went to Sugi Yonggang to the public announced, Sugi as a major shareholder of Sugi Yonggang, decided to implement a two-system, in addition to Zheng Yonggang as chairman, Sugi enterprise people do not send to Sugi Yonggang, take the way of authorized management, the original distribution system, corporate culture, management and other modes unchanged.	no

阿拉斯加上空被击落的 “物体”究竟是什么？	What was the “object” shot down over Alaska?	yes
扑朔迷离，猜测纷纷	Confused, speculated.	yes
美国军方周五（2月10日）下午再次动用美国最先进的隐身喷气战机F-22击落了一个在美国阿拉斯加上空飞行的尚未确定身份的物体。	On Friday afternoon, the U.S. military again shot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska using the U.S. state-of-the-art stealth jet, the F-22.	yes
击落的地点距离阿拉斯加海岸十英里。	It was shot down 10 miles off the Alaska coast.	yes
这是美军在不到一周的时间里第二次击落空中飞行物体。	This is the second time U.S. forces have shot down an aerial object in less than a week.	yes
上周六，来自中国的一个间谍气球在美国领空上漂移数日后在美国南卡罗莱纳州沿岸附近上空被击毁。	On Saturday, a spy balloon from China was destroyed off the coast of South Carolina after drifting over U.S. airspace for days.	yes
五角大楼说，第二个被击落的物体于周四晚上首次进入美国领空，在阿拉斯加东北部上空移动时被美国军方跟踪，飞行高度为1.2万米（4万英尺），其大小与一辆小型汽车差不多，与先前被击落的那个中国间谍气球相比要小很多。	The Pentagon said the second shot-down object, which first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), was about the size of a small car and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was previously shot down.	yes
五角大楼还认为，目前没有迹象显示，这个物体是可操纵的。	The Pentagon also believes there is no indication that the object is manoeuvrable.	yes
白宫国家安全委员会战略沟通协调员约翰·科比周五表示，虽然这个在高空飞行的物体的具体样子尚不清楚，但它“对民航飞机的安全构成了合理的威胁”。	John Kobe, the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, said Friday that while the exact appearance of the object flying at high altitude was unclear, it "represented a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aviation aircraft."	yes
科比表示，这个物体与美国境内发现的那个间谍气球不同，它上面没有悬挂“有效载荷”。	Kobe said the object, unlike the spy balloon found inside the United States, had no "payload" hanging on it.	yes
科比说，“我们把它称为一个‘物体’是我们目前能够作出的最好的描述”。	Kobe said, “We call it an ‘object’ is the best description we can give at the moment.”	no
拜登总统在下令击落这个物体之前听取了五角大楼的建议，他作出这个决定的时候“非常谨慎”，科比补充说。	President Biden listened to the Pentagon’s advice before ordering the object to be shot down, and he was “very cautious” in making that decision.	no
美国官方对这个物体的描述大致可以归纳为：大小相当于一辆小汽车，没有操纵杆，没有悬挂装置，飞行高度为一万米左右。	The official description of the object in the United States can be roughly summed up as: the size of a car, no joystick, no suspension device, and a flight altitude of about 10,000 meters.	no
但这些信息还无法回答基本问题，比如这个物体究竟是什么东西，它属于哪个国家，它在执行什么任务。	But that information doesn’t answer basic questions like what the object is, what country it belongs to, what mission it’s performing.	no
目前网上许多的分析和猜测认为，这可能又是一只中国气球。	Many online analyses and speculations suggest that this may be another Chinese balloon.	no
它可能与入侵美国领空的那只间谍气球和在拉美上空飘动的那只中国气球一样都来自中国，它们在不同地点执行某种任务。	It could come from China, like the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, carrying out some sort of mission at different locations.	no
也有人把阿拉斯加的这个“物体”与“不明飞行物”（UFO）联系在一起。	Some have also linked the Alaskan “object” to a “unidentified flying object” (UFO).	no
美国新闻周刊的报道引用美国前众议员彼得·梅杰（Peter Meijer）周五在推特上发出的推文说，“真希望这个‘不明飞行物’也是一个间谍气球，而不是一个合法的UFO”。	The U.S. Newsweek report quoted former U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer tweeted Friday, saying, “I wish this UFO was also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO.”	no
“将外星飞船与气象气球混为一谈的讽刺意味很令人惊讶，但这不值得引发一场星际冲突，”梅杰说。	"The irony of confusing an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth triggering an interstellar conflict," Major said.	no
梅杰是在科比证实阿拉斯加的这个物体被击落之后不久发出这个推文的。	Major tweeted shortly after Kobe confirmed that the Alaskan object had been shot down.	no
新闻周刊说，怀疑这个物体是UFO的不止是梅杰一人。	Newsweek said it was more than just Major who suspected the object was a UFO.	no
田纳西共和党籍众议员蒂姆·伯切特（Tim Burchett）批评政府上个月的掩盖情报的做法，要求国家情报总监办公室 (DNI)公布有关“不明飞行物”的报告。	Rep. Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, criticized the administration’s cover-up of intelligence last month, asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on “unidentified flying objects.”	no

让人无法理解的袖子	Sleeves that are incomprehensible.	yes
说是牛皮的，也确实比较硬，但仔细看的话，局部有很多细小的裂痕，搞不清楚是否是真皮的，另外这个衣服的袖子真是让人无法理解，通常夹克的袖子要比衣摆长一些，不过通常也就1-2厘米，这件衣服足足长了5厘米，手臂自然下垂应该在手掌虎口的位置，但这件衣服的袖子都盖过手指了。	Speaking of cowhide, it is indeed relatively hard, but if you look closely, there are a lot of small cracks, do not know whether it is leather, in addition, the sleeve of this dress is really incomprehensible, usually the jacket sleeve is longer than the coat, but usually 1-2 cm, this dress is long enough for 5 cm, the arm naturally drooping should be in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this dress are covered by the fingers.	yes
买衣服容易，退货也容易。	Buying clothes is easy and returning them is easy.	yes
但是要退还钱真不知何时？	Do you know when to return the money?	yes

而且要购买者自已和那个诚信度不怎么样的全峰快递联系，这是自购亚马逊的物品以来最糟糕的一次购物！	And to get the buyer in touch with the poor integrity of the Peak Courier, this is the worst purchase since buying an item from Amazon!	yes
但店家还是不错的，积极配合催促快递及时退款，但是这个全峰快递实在的工作是做的相当让人愤怒，拖拉半个月左右才退款，这种合作伙伴是要拖亚马逊的后腿的，工作效率差，没有服务意识！	But the store is still good, actively cooperate with the prompt delivery of timely refunds, but this peak delivery real work is done quite infuriating, delaying about half a month to refund, this partner is to drag Amazon's back legs, poor work efficiency, no service consciousness!	yes

商品内部怎么可能磨损？	How can goods be worn inside?	yes
只有两种可能，要么次品旧品，要么就是我故意损坏商品，然后拿去退货。	There are only two possibilities, either second-hand goods, or I intentionally damage the goods and return them.	yes
客观来讲，我没有证据证明我没有损坏商品，但是以我在亚马逊购物的信用记录来讲，我认为这样的商品不应该出现在亚马逊自营商品中，客户选择亚马逊自营就是信任，customer win，we win，客户的胜利就是厂商的胜利，希望大家一起努力改进，谢谢。	Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the goods, but to my credit history of shopping on Amazon, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon self-owned goods, customers choose Amazon self-owned is trust, customer win, we win, customer victory is the victory of the manufacturer, hope we all work together to improve, thank you.	yes
我使用该产品不到一年，就出现两个E2，我不知道如何处理?	I’ve been using this product for less than a year and two E2 appear, I don’t know what to do with it.	yes
我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?	I bought the product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two groups on the right of the receiver often appear red E2, should be a problem with the launch module, this is not consistent with the launch module sustainable work on Amazon website 7 years, can not find on Amazon website after-sales, now do not know how to be good?	yes

我当初购买的页面尺码选项为7c，8，9c，当时觉得这就是个陷阱，打电话给日亚中文客服，明确告知8就是8c，但是等商品回到中国才发现，只有8cm，我觉得这完全是故意设下的陷阱来坑中国人（按照亚马逊的售后），现在查看页面已没有这个选项。	I originally bought the page size options for 7c, 8, 9c, then I think this is a trap, call the Japanese Chinese customer service, clearly inform that 8 is 8c, but when the goods return to China only found, only 8cm, I think this is a deliberate trap to pit the Chinese (according to Amazon's after-sales), now view the page has no this option.	yes

选择2，我有鞋子，最后补偿了我2000日元，最后损失在150rmb 客服：我们已记录下来，我们会认真处理，次日回了封邮件，说我不接受中方客服调解，就这么完了。	Option 2, I have shoes, finally compensated me 2000 yen, the last loss in 150rmb customer service: we have recorded, we will seriously deal with, the next day I returned an email, saying I do not accept Chinese customer service mediation, that's it.	yes
我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	I proposed: when buying a page for 7c, 8, 9c such a confusing option, the Chinese customer service helped me to say that the Japanese common code is not to carry c, like 140, but do you have to go to other caterpillar pages to see?	yes
都有美码，日码混标的情况出现。	There are good code, day code mixed situations appear.	no
再说，你8cm为什么放在7c和9c中间，明明最小的尺码，你放那里算什么意思。	Also, why do you put 8cm in the middle of 7c and 9c, obviously the smallest size, what do you mean by putting it there?	no
中方客服：我们提供中文服务，但是不知道你要运回国，所以你的运费我们是不予理赔的。	Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we do not know that you want to ship back home, so we do not pay for your shipping costs.	no
这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	This logic I do not understand, I am Japanese, I also need Chinese customer service, living in Japan China does not need Chinese customer service, to go to Japan tourists, without that kungfu to play international long distance, then the problem comes, who needs to call Amazon overseas to buy Chinese phone, nothing but like me such a day-to-day.	no
亚马逊中文客服不就是方便了我们海淘的这些人吗？	Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just convenient for these people?	no
这次购买不是很满意	This purchase was not satisfactory.	yes
这是第二次从亚马逊上购买帮宝适尿布，曾经在宝宝2个月的时候买过一箱，选择了欧洲进口纸张的尿布，第一次购买经历还是比较满意的，宝宝整夜就用一张尿布，的确可以满足12个小时不换尿布。	This is the second time from Amazon to buy baby diapers, once in the baby 2 months bought a box, selected Europe imported paper diapers, the first purchase experience is still relatively satisfactory, the baby all night with a diaper, indeed can meet 12 hours without changing diapers.	yes

按着这个剧情来说，整本书都是比较轻松愉快的，前部分叶修还在网游里的时候，即使是公会之间勾心斗角，也因为往往被叶神狗血，搞得一点也不沉重。	According to this plot, the whole book is relatively easy and enjoyable, the first part of Ye Shu is still in the online game, even between the guilds, but also because often by Ye God dog blood, not at all heavy.	yes

看整部书花了我高二许多学习时间，可是就是停不下来。	Reading the whole book took me a lot of time to study, but I just can’t stop.	yes
全职对人物和感情线的描写让人十分惊艳，有的人物只是偶尔带过，也会给人留下很深的影响，像比较重点描写的角色叶修黄少天苏沐橙都有大量的粉丝，而不在写作中心的角色例如江波涛楚云秀等等也十分找人喜欢，在一个电竞的爽文中竟然让人找不到一个让人讨厌至极的人物，这是全职在人物描写上的成功。	Full-time description of the characters and emotional lines makes people very amazing, some characters only occasionally brought, will also leave a deep impact, like the focus of the character Ye Shu Huang Tian Su Huang Orange have a large number of fans, and not in the writing center of the characters such as Jiang Pota Chu Yun Xiu, etc. are also very much looking for people, in an e-sports game even let people not find a hateful character, this is a full-time success in the character description.	yes

今年4月份全职要动漫化。	Full-time animation will take place in April.	no
其实想要买齐这套书很久了，碍于永远钱包不够厚都没狠下心下手，然后想要买的时候就发现，tb上简直是假货猖獗，其实全职最近出了另一个版本，封面图吧我自己是蛮喜欢的，但还是打算先买老的版本，所以就在亚马逊上看了看，一次性买下来了一套。	In fact, I want to buy this set of books for a long time, because the wallet is not thick enough not hard to start, then I want to buy when I found that TB is simply fake rampant, in fact, full-time recently released another version, cover map I myself is quite like, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I looked at it on Amazon, bought a set at once.	no
接下来简单说一下货的情况。	Next, let’s briefly describe the situation of the goods.	no

落寞的小狮子	The lonely little lion.	yes
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as The Lost Corner, and the result was a lot of words!	yes
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	I read it three times before reading the book to children, a little lion who can shoot, a little lion who loves to eat juice soft sugar.	yes
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	When the lion eats the hunter, there is a slight discomfort, and modern urban people are a bit uncomfortable with such an arrangement being eaten by animals.	yes
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	In the end, this little lion, who has succeeded in human society, has lost himself, and is no longer a complete lion, nor a complete man.	yes
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	At last, only the back of the little lion, did not know where he had gone.	yes
可能多年以后，这个小狮子的形象还留在长大了的小朋友的印象中，在某一天不经意的时候被想起，或许对她会有触动或是启发。	Perhaps years later, the image of this little lion still remains in the impression of a grown child, in a certain day inadvertently remembered, perhaps touching or inspiring her.	yes
性价比很高的作品集	Cost-effective collection.	yes
1、以前还不知道TASCHEN，最近买了不少他们的书，原因就是太强悍，不论是选题还是制作本身。	Previously did not know TASCHEN, recently bought a lot of their books, the reason is too strong, whether it is the choice of the subject or the production itself.	yes
本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	The book has been published in three editions, the largest version, like the Michelangelo collection, is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this edition is the smallest, and comes with two books in a book box.	yes
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	Personally, I think it is also acceptable, the price is cheap, and more than 700 pages divided into two, as paperback is also better to read; the second is different from the Michelangelo collection, the painting occupies the main body, Da Vinci this black and white manuscript accounted for most, for the limited budget, non-art professional readers, this edition as the appreciation of paintings and manuscripts cost-effectiveness ratio is the highest.	yes
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	2, the explanation of the painting part is great, there is composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the last supper), but do not know if it is printing or book size problem, some shadow part of the county is too deep, can not see the details, a little regret.	yes
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	Compared with Michelangelo's manuscript, Da Vinci's manuscript content is much richer.	yes
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius, and the latter is not a genius enough to describe.	yes
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	If before you could only see half of Da Vinci by looking at paintings, you would be completely speechless after reading the manuscript.	yes
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Who buys junk, who regrets it!	yes
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	Never give bad reviews, this genuine rubbish, bought a waste of money horse, give a reason!	yes

发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	Shipping speed is still quite fast, here to tug a little express brother, valuable items are put in the concierge, go fast, I can not check in front of him out of the box, on this point is really speechless.	yes

1. 在 3 月 29 号，通过预购途径使用 31 元购买了此书，显示 3 月 31 号会推送到设备上，此时亚马逊官网上还无法预览该书（因为还未发布）；	On March 29, the book was purchased for $31 through pre-order channels, showing that March 31 will be pushed to the device, at which time the Amazon official website could not preview the book (because it has not yet been released);	yes

目前我有几点感想	I have some feelings right now.	yes
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	The question of price is not the most important, the key is now how to replace the blank book on Kindle with the actual content of the book, instead of forever downloading it is "please look forward"	yes
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	Pre-ordered books should not be bought again, after all, in case of skipping tickets, then download an empty book content, the procedure looks very complicated;	yes
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	Hopefully Amazon will give a normal channel for feedback on such issues, when the e-book download, or use of doubts can have local feedback (work orders, online customer service can, you can refer to Microsoft's official store how to do)	yes
不是很推荐阅读	Not highly recommended reading.	yes
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	I read it a long time ago and I happened to read it from memory.	yes
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	This book is not so much a collection of short stories as a collection of fragments about love in life.	yes
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The tone of the book is extremely bland, is the kind of white boiling water flat, the sentence is the pursuit of simplicity to the extreme, the plot is also like a summer afternoon street, quiet flat.	yes
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Every short story is a silhouette of a small period of ordinary life, with no beginning and no ending.	yes
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	The final collection is titled “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.	yes
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I think, this novel collection, and its title, like a kind of behavioral art, the author wants to express is that love is not only the stage of grief and joy, urban legend of the sea stony rot, not only you Nong I Nong like paint, love is not only the above should not be represented above, love is also plain as water life, boring tasteless day after day, there is also a lack of life, reality escape, future dullness.	yes
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	As you read this book, you may be reminded of the fighting couples next to you, the tasteless marriages of people you know, and the unhappy feelings.	yes
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	This is exactly why I do not recommend reading, from an aesthetic point of view, the text and plot of the book are tasteless, unless your life is chaotic or sweet as life in a candy castle, otherwise you have to read the feeling is strange and boring.	yes
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	In the depths of thought, the daily plot doesn’t brighten or expand one’s mind and vision (unlike Marx’s “Love in the Cholera”), and the short clips don’t address any questions, such as what mistakes lead to the failure of love?	yes
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	The breakdown of the main character’s marriage is due to those reasons.	no
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	So I don’t recommend reading this book, it doesn’t make much sense to read it.	no
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	The author’s ideas are expressed more through techniques and genres than through storylines, which is also the reason for the poor reading experience of the book.	no
适合粗读,不能细看。	Good for reading, not looking at it.	yes
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	The logic of the book is good, but the content is not rich enough.	yes
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	A lot of sales theory explains what and why, but is weak on how to do it, only points the way but does not give concrete practices.	yes
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	In addition, the book feels like a patchwork.	yes
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	For example, there are both domestic and foreign; there are both well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and well-known people.	yes
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	I don’t know if it’s a story compiled for example, but it’s more convincing to cite some of the authors’ personal experiences.	yes
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	The name of the customer or customer has changed.	yes
标题上还是顾客,正文中就变成客户了。	The title is still a customer, and in the title it becomes a customer.	yes
电子书中还出现了错别字、标点符号缺失、编号错误的问题。	There are also problems with misspelling, missing punctuation, and numbering errors in the e-book.	yes
总之,这本书作为理论入门是个不错的选择,但对于已经从事销售工作想要提高销售水平的人就不太适用了。	All in all, this book is a good introduction to theory, but less suitable for people who already work in sales and want to improve their sales.	yes
快速了解互联网金融的导读书	A quick understanding of internet finance	yes

且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	And the book time is earlier, the later Alipay WeCredit subsidy war to cultivate user habits content has not been mentioned, today's third-party payment share is just not the proportion said in the book so small.	yes

我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	I think it’s not important that you know exactly what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can express your appreciation and gratitude to the people around you, whether they’re family, friends or co-workers, in those five languages at any time.	yes

疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	Suspected counterfeit goods, please check Amazon strictly.	yes
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	Super poor quality, loose packaging, no weight, even less than the roadside stall products, no weight, no bar code, ten bags packaging is loose, completely not the characteristics of qualified products; is Amazon's worst shopping experience, has applied for returns; completely belongs to the quality problem; recommended merchants to wipe their eyes, refuse inferior goods; addition: also bought heart print, supermarket 23 yuan/10 volume, added a few contrast photos, further verify the counterfeit of the product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, avoid economic loss and further unhappy mood!	yes

黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	Black five time of the order, the result of waiting a long time did not receive, the following inquiry, the package has already been signed, asked the colleagues around are said not to help sign, urgently contact the courier company, but said to send the party to initiate the inquiry, contacted Amazon customer service, waited more than ten days, finally figure out is the courier was mistakenly thrown to others, and a few turns to finally get back the courier, the outer packaging has been dismantled, the goods are still considered complete, do not know have been used, in short, it is bad.	yes

操作系统一般般	Operating system generally	yes
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	After a while, overall, the picture can still, feel no difference, that is, the system let people watch the entanglement, the startup time is obviously a little slow, can not carry out a good set-up, the software is not required to comment, the response speed is more general, and compared to colleagues that is not an order of magnitude.	yes

在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	Amazon has accumulated a lot of unrated orders, so I used a single copy of the sentence as a review.	yes
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I use this paragraph to rate this product, it means that it has a score of at least 85 points.	yes

低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	Good price, no fever is enough!	yes
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	Such a cheap line, but it should be to reach the HDMI certification standard, personally compared to the second to kill the domestic Akiba original these bullshit stuff (the price is twice as expensive), the line is sturdy, also relatively soft, 7 meters transmission no noise, the low price line recognition doubled!	yes

我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I have previously bought in Jingdong and Suning policy items that can not be returned, including milk, diapers, etc., contact customer service are returned, and Jingdong diapers are opened after the taste is too great contact customer service is still returned, to you Amazon will not.	yes
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with them?	yes
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	Tell me either I take it myself, or let the dispatcher buy it themselves, it would not be easy for the dispatcher, why do I ask people to pay for what they did not buy themselves?	yes

劝大家不要白花钱	I urge everyone not to spend money.	yes
首先满怀期待购买，觉得都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧，收到了以后看包装觉得还可以，个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感，吃到嘴里完全没有味道，寡淡无味，咬开来果肉一圈是暗黄色就是坏了那种，好坏参着卖的，能吃的也就不到三分之一，劝大家不要买，也不便宜，质量太差了！	First full of expectation to buy, feel that the Dole brand should not be bad where to go, after receiving the packaging feel ok, the head is still good, but there is a box basically are soft, the appearance is not visible, to feel, to eat in the mouth completely no taste, faint tasteless, bite off the flesh a circle is dark yellow is broken that kind, good and bad sold, can eat is less than a third, advise you not to buy, not cheap, quality is too bad!	yes

产品防伪标识在哪里	Where is the anti-counterfeiting product?	yes
瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的，从外包装袋看，感觉蹂躏的程度让人揪心，毕竟是食物类的包装太简单了，而且还是属于国际购的，还有没看到什么明显的防伪标识标志，开瓶非常轻松，关键是盖内的一层蜂蜜直接从里面冒出来了，有开口几乎是没有什么粘连性，外国产品都是这样的吗？	Bottle of the bottom corner of the depression of the strong, should be experienced a strong impact to lead, from the outer packaging bag, feel the degree of devastation is heartbreaking, after all, food packaging is too simple, and still belongs to the international purchase, there is no obvious anti-counterfeiting logo, opening the bottle very easy, the key is a layer of honey inside the cover directly from the inside, there is almost no stickiness, foreign products are like this?	yes

提货服务有待改进	Delivery services need to be improved	yes
我一共买了5份提货券，在提取时，第一次预约提取3份，结果只寄过来2份，经过多方沟通才确认是漏发、答应后需补发；第二次预约，刚好赶上休息日，网站和微信均无提示需要在工作日预约，造成了不必要的恐慌，建议以后改善。	I bought a total of 5 coupons, at the time of extraction, the first appointment to extract 3 copies, the result was only sent 2 copies, after multiple communication to confirm the leakage, promise to be reissued; the second appointment, just to catch the rest day, the website and WeChat are no hints need to make an appointment on the working day, caused unnecessary panic, suggested improvements later.	yes
不错的购物	Good shopping.	yes
东西好评！	Something good!	yes
还是比较相信亚马逊自营的东西，现在海外购以后很方便，从国外买回来物流时间比国内也就多几天，不得不说亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的，比走转运要快很多，所以现在很多东西都在海外购上买。	Or rather believe in Amazon's own business, now overseas purchase is very convenient, from abroad to buy back logistics time than domestic is also a few days, I have to say that Amazon overseas purchase to domestic customs clearance capacity is still very strong, than transhipment is much faster, so now a lot of things are bought overseas.	yes

如果我只是碰到一个这样的，我认了，买了几个都是这样子，找亚马逊客服，客服就说可以退，但运费垫付，然后运费以礼品卡的形式返回给我。	If I just come across one of these, I admit, bought a few are like this, look for Amazon customer service, customer service said can return, but the shipping fee is advanced, and then the shipping fee is returned to me in the form of a gift card.	yes
我试问一下，我用现金支付运费，你们给我返礼品卡，这是要我自己买你们礼品卡就直说啊，还要自己把产品邮寄到德国仓库，这不是买个产品受罪啊!	I try to ask, I pay for shipping with cash, you give me back the gift card, this is to buy your gift card myself, but also to mail the product to the German warehouse, this is not a crime to buy a product!	yes
而我一直跟客服说，出现这样的问题是谁的责任，客服却半句不说是他们的责任，连半句责任都不敢担当，这样的售后服务还有什么保障呢? 一句话:认栽!但我估计我这个评价，亚马逊都不会给公布的机会，直接回删除!

4，如果亚马逊没有标注预计到货时间是2月7号，我或许会很满意。	If Amazon didn’t mark the expected arrival date of February 7, I’d probably be happy.	yes

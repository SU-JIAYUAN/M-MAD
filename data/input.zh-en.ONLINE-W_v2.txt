描述 (DESCRIPTION) C 和 C++ 编译器是集成的.他们都要用四个步骤中的一个或多个处理输入文件: 预处理(preprocessing), Hii(compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking) .	DESCRIPTION The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.	yes
源文件后级名标识源文件的语言, 但是对编译器来说, 后绥名控制着缺省设定:	The source filename identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the sui generis name controls the default setting.	yes
gcc 认为预处理后的文件(.i) 是 c 文件, 并且设定 c 形式的连接，	gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c-file, and sets up a c-form link.	yes

.h 预处理器文件; 通常不出现在命令行上其他后级名的文件被传递给连接器 (Linker).通常包括:	.h preprocessor files; files that do not normally appear on the command line with other postnames are passed to the Linker. Typically these include.	no
.0 目标文件 (Object file)	.0 Object file	no
.a 归档库文件(Archive file)	.a Archive file	no
除非使用了 -cec，-s, 或 -E 选项(或者编译错误阻止了完整的过程),否则连接总是最后的步骤.	Unless the -cec, -s, or -E option is used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process), linking is always the last step.	no
在连接阶段中,所有对应于源程序的.e 文件，-1 库文件, 无法识别的文件名(包括指定的.o H 标文件和 .a 库文件)按命令行中的顺序传递给连接器选项 (OPTIONS)	During the linking phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognizable filenames (including specified .o H files and .a library files) are passed to the connector options in the order they appear on the command line.	no
选项必须分立给出 : de ' 完全不同于 `-d -r '.	The options must be given separately : de ' is completely different from `-d -r '.	no
大多数 ` -=E :和 `-W' 选项有两个相反的格式 : -fname 和 -fno-name (或 -Wname 和 -Wno- name).	Most ` -=E :and `-W' options have two opposite formats : -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno- name).	no
这里只列举不是默认选项的格式.	Only formats that are not the default option are listed here.	no
下面是所有选项的摘要, 按类型分组, 解释放在后面的章节中.	Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in the sections that follow.	no
代码生成选项 (Code Generation Option)	Code Generation Option	yes
总体选项 (Overall Option)	Overall Option	yes
明确指出后面输入文件的语言为 language (而不是从文件名后绥得到的默认选择).	Specify the language of the file to be entered as language (instead of the default choice derived from the filename).	yes
这个选项应用于后面所有的输入文件, 直到遇着下一个 `-x' 选项 .language 的可选	This option is applied to all subsequent input files, until the next `-x' option, .language, is encountered.	yes
关闭任何对语种的明确说明, 因此依据文件名后级处理后面的文件 RE AS E ` -x' 选项).	Turns off any explicit specification of the language, and therefore processes subsequent files based on the filename descendant RE AS E ` -x' option).	yes
如果只操作四个阶段( 预处理, 编译, 汇编, 连接)中的一部分, 可以使用 ` -x' 选项 (或文件名后 Ah) 告诉 geo 从哪里开始,用 `~-c' ，`-s' ,或 `-E' 选项告诉 geo 到哪里结束.注意,某些选项组合 (例如 ，`-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c 编译或汇编源文件, ETER. ERA ATI 缺省情况下， GCC 通过用 ` .o' 蔡换源文件名后级 ` .ec 标文件名. 可以使用-o 选项选择其他名字.GCC忽略 -ec 选项后面任何无法识别的输入文伯 -S F 何事情.	If only part of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking) is to be manipulated, the ` -x' option (or Ah after the filename) can be used to tell geo where to start, and the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' options can be used to tell geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (e.g., `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compiles or assembles the source file, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC labels the file with ` .ec' after the source filename by replacing it with ` .o'. GCC ignores any unrecognized input text after the -ec option -S F anything.	yes
了的目标文件.	The objective of the document is to provide a clearer picture of the situation in the country.	yes
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	Stop after compilation, no assembly.	yes
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	Work with pipes instead of temporary files between different stages of the compilation process, because the assembler of those systems can not read data from pipes, GNU's assembler does not have this problem, the assembler is able to accept the C "dialect": support for ANSI-compliant C programs.	yes
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This turns off certain keywords in GNU Cc that are not ANSI Cc-compatible features, as well as ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, which are welcome and rarely used, and the main function, which returns an int value, even though it is disabled for use in all the standard libraries available in the hosted environment. Typical examples are almost all programs except the kernel. The corresponding f£reestanding environment has no standard libraries, and the entry point to a program is not necessarily main, the most obvious example being the operating system kernel. (For more information, see the recent information on the gcc website).	yes
对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	Function declarations without arguments, e.g. `int foo ();', are handled in the C style - i.e. without specifying the number or type of arguments. (C++ only) .	no
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	Normally, such a function foo means that the argument is empty in C++.	no
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	The list of sections from which to delete attempts to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.	no
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	See the NU c manual for details, which we've removed so that people won't HERI when the content becomes obsolete.	no
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the ` -traditional' option has the added effect of allowing this to be assigned a value.	no
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	He has the same effect as the `-Ethis-is-variable' option.	no
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.	no
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	In particular, the preprocessor is mentioned above, but not the other effects of the `-traditional' option.	no
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	-fdollars-in-identifiers allows `$' characters in identifiers (C++ only) .	no
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	You can specify the `"-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly disable the `$' character.	no
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	(GNU C++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not all.)	no
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	-fenum-int-equiv Allows implicit conversion of ant types to enumeration types (MEF c++) .	no
正常情况下 GNU C++ 允许从 enum 到 int 的转换,反之则不行.	Normally GNU C++ allows conversions from enum to int, but not vice versa.	no
-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	-fexternal--templates Produces smaller code for template declarations (c++ only) by generating a copy of each template function only in the place where they are defined.	no
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	To use this option successfully, you must mark `#pragma implementatio' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use the template.	no
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates ', the template instantiation is all external. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.	no
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	This can be accomplished with a typedef, which references each instance needed.	no
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	In contrast, if compiled with the default option ` -fno-exteznal-templates', all template instances are explicitly built-in.	no
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All member functions (except constructors and the mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of their class.	no
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	This does not mean that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.	no
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	In some cases, the compiler is able to determine that a virtual function can be called directly; then it is called directly.	no
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch Allows type mismatches between the second and third arguments of a conditional expression.	no
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	The value of such an expression is Void.-fthis--is-variable allows assignment of a value to this (only for c++).	no
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	Merging a user-defined free storage management mechanism into c++ makes the assignable `this' obsolete.	no
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	Thus, by default, assigning a value to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.	no
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	However, for backward compatibility, you can make this work with the `-fthis-is-variable' option.	no
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	-funsigned-char Defines a char as an unsigned type, like an unsigned char.	no
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Each machine has its own default char type. It can be either an unsigned char or a signed char.	no
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the signed nature of the data.	no
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	But many programs have been written to use just a simple char, and expect it to be signed (or unsigned, depending on the target machine for which the program is written).	no
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This option, and its inverse, makes the program work with the corresponding default values.	no
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	The type of a char should always be explicitly defined as either signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.	no
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	If the ` signed' or `unsigned' modifiers are not explicitly declared, these options are used to define either a signed bitfield or an unsigned bitfield.	no
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	By default, bitfields are signed because the basic integer types they inherit from, such as int, are signed; however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bitfields are always unsigned.	no
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	-fwritable-strings stores string constants in a writable segment, and does not treat them as such.	no
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	This is for compatibility with some older programs, where changing string constants is a very bad idea, and the `-traditional' option has the same effect.	no

与此同时，各国政府削减了与毒品相关的预算。	At the same time, Governments have cut drug-related budgets.	no
如果各国政府以同样的方式应对当前的经济衰退，预防吸毒和相关风险行为等干预措施和戒毒治疗服务可能会受到沉重打击。	Interventions such as prevention of drug use and related risk behaviours and drug treatment services may be hit hard if Governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way.	no
此外，拦截行动和国际合作的优先性可能会降低，使贩运者更容易行动。	In addition, interception operations and international cooperation may be prioritized less, making it easier for traffickers to act.	no

有信使将甲基苯丙胺等合成毒品放在随身背包或藏在私人行李中携带，有时数量很大。由于几乎各地都对航空客运实施了限制，利用商业航空旅行供应毒品的活动可能会完全中断。	Synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine are carried by couriers in carry-on backpacks or concealed in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. The use of commercial air travel for the supply of drugs may be completely disrupted by the restrictions imposed on passenger air transportation almost everywhere.	no
尽管国际邮政供应链也受到了干扰，但利用暗网和货物邮寄进行贩运的活动可能会增加。	Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, there may be an increase in the use of the dark web and the mailing of goods for trafficking purposes.	no
从长远来看，经济衰退和相关的封闭措施可能会打乱毒品市场。	In the long run, the recession and related closures may disrupt the drug market.	no
由于不断上升的失业率和缺乏机会，贫困和弱势人群将更有可能以有害的方式吸毒，患上吸毒病症，并转向与毒品有关的非法活动一无论是生产还是运输。	As a result of rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in a harmful way, develop drug use disorders and turn to illicit drug-related activities, whether production or transportation.	no

2009年估计吸毒者有2.1亿人，占全球15-64岁人口的4.8%,而2018年估计吸毒者有2.69亿人，占这类人口的5.3%。	In 2009, there were an estimated 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8 per cent of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018, there were an estimated 269 million drug users, accounting for 5.3 per cent of that population.	no
在过去二十年期间，发展中国家吸毒情况的增长速度远远快于发达国家。	During the past two decades, drug abuse in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.	no
这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。	This reflects, to some extent, the differences in overall population growth over the period, which varied from 7 per cent in developed countries to 28 per cent in developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.	no
青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。	Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.	no
在2000-2018年期间，发展中国家这一年龄段的人口增长了16%,而发达国家这一年龄段的人口减少了10%。	During the period 2000-2018, the population in this age group in developing countries increased by 16 per cent, while the population in this age group in developed countries decreased by 10 per cent.	no
1城市化是当前和未来毒品市场的一个驱动因素	1 Urbanization as a driver of current and future drug markets	no
无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。	In both developed and developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas.	no
吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。	The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the large-scale movement of people from rural to urban areas, with more than half of the world's population now living in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.	no
城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。	Urbanization is likely to be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, especially in developing countries where the trend towards urbanization is more pronounced.	no
财富的增加与吸毒情况增多相联，但承受疾病负担最大的是最贫穷的人在世界范围内，发达国家的吸毒情况比发展中国家更为普遍。	Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but it is the poorest people who bear the greatest burden of disease and, worldwide, drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.	no
可卡因之类的毒品更是与世界上较富裕的地区联系较为牢固。	Drugs such as cocaine are even more strongly associated with wealthier parts of the world.	no
同样，在各国内部，社会富裕阶层的吸毒流行率较高。	Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the wealthier segments of society.	no
但转为吸毒病症的比率较高的却是社会经济地位较低的人。	However, the rate of transition to drug use disorders is higher among people of lower socio-economic status.	no
来自少数几个国家的数据表明，有害的吸毒模式与病症同低收入之间存在联系。	Data from a small number of countries suggest that there is a link between harmful patterns of drug use and morbidity and low incomes.	no
这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。	These patterns appear to be less common in more affluent segments of society.	no
全球新冠肺炎危机造成的经济制约很可能会加剧包括吸毒者在内的最弱势群体的风险。	The economic constraints caused by the global NCRP crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.	no
例如，劳动力市场的变化，如失业率上升，过去一直与吸毒情况的增加有关，而这场疫情己经迫使全球数千万人失业。	For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked in the past to increased drug use, and the epidemic has forced tens of millions of people out of work globally.	no
新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。	CKP may lead to further expansion of the drug market The CKP pandemic may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because of a reduced capacity of State authorities to control it or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illicit activities in the context of the economic crisis.	no
新冠肺炎的相关限制措施导致空中和陆路交通减少，海上贩运可能已经因此而增加，海上的拦截风险低，而且比空中或陆路走私的数量更多。	Restrictions related to NCRP have led to a decrease in air and land traffic, and trafficking by sea may have increased as a result, with the risk of interception at sea being low and greater than that of smuggling by air or land.	no
最近已有报告称可卡因货物直接从南美经由海路运往欧洲。	There have been recent reports of cocaine consignments being transported directly from South America to Europe by sea.	no
复杂性增强	Increased complexity	yes
非国际管制物质的出现情况稳定，但有潜在危害的新型类阿片正在增多毒品市场正日趋复杂。	The emergence of substances not under international control has stabilized, but new and potentially harmful opioids are on the rise and the drug market is becoming increasingly complex.	yes
除大麻、可卡因和海洛因等植物类物质之外，已经增添了数百种合成毒品，其中许多并不在国际管制之下。药品的非医疗使用也快速增多。	In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs is also increasing rapidly.	yes
会员国的国内市场每年约有500种新型活性物质。	The domestic markets of Member States are characterized by approximately 500 new active substances per year.	yes
目前其中大多是兴奋剂，其次是合成的大麻素受体激动剂和少量的类阿片。	Most of these are now stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and, to a lesser extent, opioids.	yes
虽然新型精神活性物质的总体数量已经稳定下来，但比例发生了变化。	While the overall quantity of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.	yes
在2014年确定的新型精神活性物质种类总数中，类阿片新型精神活性物质仅占2%,但到2018年，这一数字己上升至9%。	Opioids accounted for only 2 per cent of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, but by 2018 that figure had risen to 9 per cent.	yes
类阿片新型精神活性物质中有许多是芬太尼的类似物，其药效和危害已得到证明，在北美导致了过量死亡事件，其他区域也有，但程度较轻。	Many of the new opioid psychoactive substances are analogues of fentanyl, whose efficacy and harm have been demonstrated, leading to overdose deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, in other regions.	yes
在北美，芬太尼有的用作海洛因和其他毒品（包括可卡因和甲基苯丙胺）的掺杂剂，有的用来制造假冒的药用类阿片。	In North America, fentanyl is used either as an adulterant in heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine) or to manufacture counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.	yes
一些证据表明，欧洲也有注射新型精神活性物质兴奋剂的现象：一项对欧洲六个城市废弃注射器残留物的研宄发现，许多注射器都沾有产生兴奋作用的新型精神活性物质》	There is some evidence that new psychoactive substance stimulants are also being injected in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many of the syringes were tainted with new psychoactive substances with a euphoric effect.	yes
2新型精神活性物质的使用可能会逐渐牢固存在于弱势群体中	2 Use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly established in vulnerable groups	no
单一种类的新型精神活性物质几乎从未形成大的市场。	There is almost never a large market for a single type of new psychoactive substance.	no
但来自欧洲的证据表明，合成大麻素在无家可归者和监狱囚犯等社会边缘群体中是一个严重的问题。	However, evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.	no
有22个国家报告了监狱中使用新型精神活性物质的情况，其中大多数国家将合成大麻素确定为主要挑战。	Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most of them identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.	no
对前体化学品的管制迫使制毒者进行创新最常作为前体用来合成苯丙胺、甲基苯丙胺和“摇头丸”等毒品的许多化学品已被置于国际管制之下。	Controls on precursor chemicals have forced drug makers to innovate Many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamines, methamphetamines and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.	no
贩毒者和制毒者一直在寻找替代品一不仅有管制较松的物质，还有专门为规避管制而设计的化学品，即所谓的“特制前体”。	Drug traffickers and producers are constantly looking for alternatives, not only for less regulated substances, but also for chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, so-called "designer precursors".	no
旨在阻止新冠肺炎传播的限制性措施很可能使依赖前体化学品的制毒者受到进一步挤压。	Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of NCP are likely to put a further squeeze on drug producers who rely on precursor chemicals.	no
来自墨西哥的证据表明，这已经成为 现实：据报告，2020年3月，从东亚进口的甲基苯丙胺前体短缺促使墨西哥和美国的甲基苯丙胺价格上涨。	Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: in March 2020, a reported shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia contributed to an increase in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.	no
市场瞬息万变	The market is changing rapidly.	no
合成药物在中亚和俄罗斯联邦取代阿片剂	Replacement of opiates by synthetic drugs in Central Asia and the Russian Federation	no
中亚和俄罗斯联邦的阿片剂市场在2008年至2018年期间似乎发生了变化。	The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.	no
俄罗斯联邦当局截获的阿片剂数量下降了约80%，同时因使用类阿片而接受治疗的人数大幅减少。	The number of opiates intercepted by the authorities of the Russian Federation declined by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use decreased significantly.	no

结晶甲基苯丙胺已经成为“芬乃他林”和曲马多之外又一种令人担忧的主要药物。	Crystallized methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern in addition to "fenetylline" and tramadol.	no
2015年的一项研宄进一步证实了这些发现，吸毒者表示大麻比“芬乃他林”或甲基苯丙胺更难获得。	These findings were further confirmed by a 2015 study in which drug users reported that marijuana was more difficult to obtain than "fenetylline" or methamphetamine.	no
最近，伊拉克当局发现了多个甲基苯丙胺加工点，麻管局已对伪麻黄碱制剂的大批进口表示关切一甲基苯丙胺加工点将这些制剂用作前体。	Recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine laboratories, and the Board has expressed concern about the large-scale importation of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors in methamphetamine laboratories.	no
在阿富汗，甲基苯丙胺制造似乎始于2014年。	In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacture appears to have begun in 2014.	no
自那时起，甲基苯丙胺的缉获量一直在稳步上升。	Since then, seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing.	no
但2019年上半年的缉获量一^657公斤——与上一年相比大幅骤增。	However, seizures in the first half of 2019 amounted to one ^657 kilograms - a significant jump compared to the previous year.	no
在其他国家大量缉获了据认为源自阿富汗的甲基苯丙胺，这也表明该国的产量正在迅速上升。	Significant seizures of methamphetamine thought to have originated in Afghanistan have been made in other countries, also indicating that production in that country is rising rapidly.	no
政策变化和变化趋势	Policy changes and trends	yes
非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域大多有大麻使用增多的趋势	Most jurisdictions that have legalized the non-medical use of cannabis have shown a trend of increased cannabis use	yes
加拿大、乌拉圭和美国的11个法域允许制造大麻产品供非医疗使用。	Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.	yes
在其中多数法域，大麻使用自合法化以来有所增多，尽管在其他未将非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域也观察到了同样的趋势。	In most of those jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized the non-medical use of cannabis.	yes
在美国最早通过立法的两个州科罗拉多州和华盛顿州，成年人非医疗使用大麻的情况增加，特别是过去一个月以及每天或几乎每天使用的情况增多，自2012年起便已超过了全国平均水平。	In Colorado and Washington, two of the first states in the U.S. to pass legislation, non-medical use of marijuana by adults has increased, especially in the past month and on a daily or near-daily basis, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.	yes
所有指标都显示，自2011年以来，乌拉圭的大麻使用情况有所增加，上月使用情况几乎翻了一番。	All indicators show an increase in cannabis use in Uruguay since 2011, with use almost doubling in the last month.	yes
这表明增加的主要原因是经常和频繁使用大麻。	This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the regular and frequent use of marijuana.	yes
加拿大的短期数据也表明，2018年至2019年合法市场扩大的同时，使用量也在增加。	Short-term data from Canada also suggests that the expansion of the legal market from 2018 to 2019 was accompanied by an increase in usage.	yes
然而，2019年仍有40%的大麻使用者靠非法来源获得某些产品。	However, 40% of marijuana users still rely on illegal sources to obtain certain products in 2019.	yes
全球大麻药草缉获量暴跌的背后原因是大麻合法化？	Marijuana Legalization Behind Plummeting Global Cannabis Herb Seizures?	yes
2018年，全球大麻药草缉获量降至20年来的最低水平，这是因为北美的缉获量下降，在过去10年中下降了 84%。	In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, driven by declining seizures in North America, which have fallen by 84 per cent over the past 10 years.	no
相比之下，同期世界其他地区的缉获量几乎翻了一番。缉获的模式表明，旨在放开大麻市场的政策在下降中发挥了关键作用。	In contrast, seizures in the rest of the world almost doubled over the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing cannabis markets have played a key role in the decline.	no
对新型精神活性物质的监管似乎有遏制作用在国内对新型精神活性物质的监管效果仍然很难评估。	Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect The effectiveness of regulation of new psychoactive substances in the country remains difficult to assess.	no

获取药用类阿片的障碍与许多因素有关，包括立法、文化、卫生系统和处方做法。	Barriers to accessing pharmaceutical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescribing practices.	no
较贫穷的人患吸毒病症的风险更大2018年约有3,560万人患有吸毒病症。	Poorer people are at greater risk of developing a drug use disorder In 2018 about 35.6 million people suffered from a drug use disorder.	no
贫困、有限的教育和社会边缘化可能会增加吸毒病症风险，并加剧其后果。高收入国家的研宄证实了这一点，在这些研究中，个人不利的社会经济轨迹一不仅仅是他们在某一时间点的状况一也与吸毒病症风险有关。	Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. This is confirmed by researchers in high-income countries, where individuals' unfavourable socio-economic trajectories, not only their situation at a given point in time, are also associated with the risk of drug use disorders.	no
吸毒病症还会加深社会经济劣势，进一步增加失业、贫困和无家可归的风险，从而助长劣势的恶性循环。这些结果也可能与刑事司法系统内的侮辱性态度和后果有关。	Drug use disorders can also deepen socio-economic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thus contributing to a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be linked to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.	no
妇女、少数民族和移民、性取向多样化群体、因武装冲突或灾难而流离失所的人以及农村环境中的人也可能受到吸毒病症的过重影响，或者在获得治疗服务方面遇到问题。	Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexually diverse groups, persons displaced by armed conflict or disaster and persons in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug use disorders or experience problems in accessing treatment services.	no
根据估计因残疾和过早死亡而损失的健康寿命年数的残疾调整寿命年（DALY)指标，在过去10年中，有害的吸毒对范围更广的社会影响加重。	According to the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death, the impact of harmful drug use on the wider society has increased over the past 10 years.	no
2007年至2018年间，归因于吸毒的全球残疾调整寿命年数增加了 17%。	Between 2007 and 2018, the number of global disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17 per cent.	no

全球范围的有限数据表明，迷醉可能是杀人的一个重要因素。	The limited data available globally suggests that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.	no
但在暴力事件中，酒精的作用似乎比毒品更大。	But alcohol seems to play a bigger role in violence than drugs.	no
虽然吸毒可能会导致犯罪，但在某些情况下，这种联系可以部分归因于多种中介因素，如社会经济劣势以及由个人风险、家庭环境和同龄人影响造成的其他类型的逆境。	While drug use may lead to offending, in some cases the link can be partially attributed to multiple mediating factors, such as socio-economic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family circumstances and peer influence.	no
贩毒和暴力之间的联系是多方面的。	The links between drug trafficking and violence are manifold.	no
如果已有稳定的犯罪结构，包括国际贩毒在内的大规模有组织犯罪活动有可能在无暴力的情况下实施。	Large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, are likely to be committed without violence if stable criminal structures are in place.	no
短期内，暴力的存在和程度与其说取决于贩运的数量，不如说取决于造成有组织犯罪集团之间力量平衡不稳定的某些变化，例如非法市场规模的变化，知名罪犯的死亡或监禁，以及使一个集团弱于另一个集团的执法措施。	In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depends less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that create an unstable balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of high-profile offenders, and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.	no
最新趋势	Latest trends	yes
吸毒大麻是最常用的物质，类阿片危害最大	Addiction Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, opioids most harmful	yes
据估计，2018年使用大麻的有 1.92 亿人，使之成为全球使用最多的毒品。	An estimated 192 million people used marijuana in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.	yes
相比之下，2018年使用类阿片的有5,800万人。	In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.	yes
但阿片类药物的相关危害却因使用者较少而受到忽视。	However, the harms associated with opioids have been overlooked because of the low number of users.	yes
在2017年与吸毒病症有关的估计167,000例死亡中，有66%是这类物质造成的，在据信为吸毒导致的残疾或过早死亡而损失的2,100万年寿命中，有50%是这类物质造成的。	Such substances were responsible for 66 percent of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, and 50 percent of the 21 million years of life believed to have been lost to disability or premature death due to drug use.	yes
合成类阿片的非医疗使用加剧了公共卫生危机	Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis	yes
在西非、中部非洲和北非，加剧类阿片危机的是曲马多；在北美则是芬太尼。这两个区域在经济、人口统计数据或一般吸毒模式方面几乎没有共同点，但都在奋力抗击由容易获得且生产成本低的物质助长的类阿片危机。	In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that fuels the opioid crisis; in North America, it is fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economies, demographics or general patterns of drug use, but both are struggling to combat the opioid crisis, which is fuelled by substances that are readily available and cheap to produce.	yes
在北美，芬太尼等合成类阿片的使用导致了20年来类阿片过量致死人数增加。	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to a 20-year increase in opioid overdose deaths.	yes
2018年，在美国登记的67,367例过量死亡中，有三分之二涉及芬太尼。	In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the U.S. involved fentanyl.	yes
加拿大也报告了类似的结果，只是数字较低。	Canada reported similar results, only in lower numbers.	no
芬太尼导致过量死亡的部分原因是非法药物市场上的芬太尼药效不可预测。	Fentanyl causes overdose deaths in part because of the unpredictable potency of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.	no
在西非、中部非洲和北非，非医疗用途曲马多的市场已有大幅增长。	In West, Central and North Africa, the market for non-medical Tramadol has grown significantly.	no
在该区域，接受治疗的曲马多使用病症患者越来越多。	An increasing number of patients with Tramadol Use Disorder are being treated in the region.	no
2017年，全球截获的曲马多数量显著增加，达到125吨以上的峰值。	In 2017, global interceptions of tramadol increased significantly, peaking at more than 125 tons.	no
但2018年，在印度通过一项监管曲马多的新法律之后，全球缉获量降至32吨。	In 2018, however, global seizures fell to 32 tons after India passed a new law regulating tramadol.	no
促成这两地危机的是制造简单和生产成本低，此外还有对曲马多和许多芬太尼类似物或其前体缺乏国际监管。	Contributing to the crises in both places were the simplicity of manufacture and the low cost of production, in addition to the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.	no
使这两地危机恶化的是这些物质在药品市场和非法市场上都有供应，因而更加难以发现和防止其滥用。	Exacerbating the crisis in both places is the fact that these substances are available on both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.	no
兴奋剂使用不断增多	Doping is on the rise	no
兴奋剂领域以可卡因和甲基苯丙胺为主，这两种物质在其主要市场的使用量都在上升。	The area of stimulants is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasing in use in their major markets.	no
2018年使用可卡因的约有1,900万人，因为可卡因在北美和西欧颇为流行。	About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.	no
同年使用苯丙胺的约有2,700万人，其中甲基苯丙胺是东南亚和北美使用最多的苯丙胺类兴奋剂。	Approximately 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.	no
根据所掌握的多数指标，20年来这两个区域甲基苯丙胺的使用一直在扩大。	According to most indicators available, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for 20 years.	no
在一些市场上，可卡因和甲基苯丙胺可以共存，有时是相互替代，这样一种药物的使用量上升时另一种药物的使用量就下降，有时是同时增加和减少以满足同一市场的需求。	In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other so that the use of one drug rises when the use of the other falls, and sometimes increasing and decreasing at the same time to meet demand in the same market.	no
新冠肺炎使注射吸毒者的风险增高	New Crown Pneumonia Puts Injecting Drug Users at Increased Risk	no
据估计，2018年注射吸毒的约有1,130万人，全球艾滋病毒感染约有10%是注射吸毒造成的。	It is estimated that about 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018 and that about 10 percent of global HIV infections are caused by injecting drug use.	no
注射吸毒者感染艾滋病毒的超过100万人，患丙型肝炎的有550万人。	More than 1 million injecting drug users are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million people have hepatitis C.	no
2017年，因吸毒死亡的约有 58.5万人，其中一半死于丙型肝炎引起的肝病，而注射吸毒者的丙型肝炎大多仍未得到治疗。	In 2017, there were about 585,000 deaths due to drug use, half of which were due to liver disease caused by hepatitis C, which remains largely untreated in injecting drug users.	no
5 新冠肺炎限制措施造成的类阿片短缺可能导致使用者代之以酒精或苯二氮类药物等更容易获得的物质，或者将类阿片与合成药物混合。	5 Shortages of opioids resulting from the NCRP restrictions may lead users to substitute more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.	no
随着一些使用者改用注射或更频繁地注射，可能会出现更多有害的使用方式。	As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful uses may occur.	no

【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	[Global Times in Belgium Special Correspondent Niu Ruifei] According to AFP on February 10, at the latest EU summit on the same day, European Commission President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce a stricter policy on illegal immigration as a way to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.	yes
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	The move by the EU is reportedly a response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, which today is centered on the small number of illegal immigrants who can ultimately be repatriated.	yes
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funds" to strengthen the external borders with infrastructure and surveillance.	yes
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	However, the EU is at loggerheads with member states over issues such as payment for the fence.	yes
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not cover the costs involved.	yes
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	But diplomatic officials from some member states say that if the EU were to share the portion of the installation of cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along the external borders, it would free up national budgets for countries to speed up the construction process.	yes
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	According to Europe's Euractiv website, EU officials have acknowledged that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, and that the EU's refugee reception system is in a near "permanent crisis" as limited reception capacity and overburdened migration authorities in member states are unable to prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications across the EU. permanent crisis".	yes
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen states received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half from the previous year.	yes
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.	no
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	In this context, the summit also agreed on the "principle" that EU countries can return illegal immigrants to their home countries on the basis of a court decision in another member state.	no
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	In addition, EU leaders agreed to "increase the use of the concept of the security state," which would open the way for the EU to develop a common list, according to the report.	no

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	U.S. escalates "chip war", hitting global semiconductor industry - CNN.com	yes
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	Recently, the U.S. "chip war" against China has escalated - first, the Netherlands, Japan and the two countries in the U.S. pressure, agreed to start the control of China's semiconductor manufacturing equipment exports; after the foreign media reports, the U.S. government is considering cutting off all links between U.S. suppliers and Huawei Between all the links between the U.S. suppliers and Huawei, prohibit U.S. suppliers to Huawei to provide any products; Biden government is also ready to publish an executive order to limit the U.S. investment in the sensitive Chinese science and technology industry ......2023 soon after the start of the year, the U.S. in the containment of China's semiconductor-related industries on the development of the evil moves constantly.	yes
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	In recent years, the United States to combat China's "core" development of the action has never stopped, while the precise suppression of China's semiconductor production and supply chain, while building a "de-Chinaization" of the semiconductor industry chain alliance, seeks to advanced semiconductor industry on the complete "Get rid of" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.	yes
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it is to draw South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or with South Korea, Japan and China Taiwan to establish a chip "four-party alliance", or by the U.S., Japan, India and Australia, "four-sided mechanism" "Indo-Pacific economic framework" and other mechanisms to establish the semiconductor industry chain "small circle", the United States through the introduction of politicization, camp, weaponized means of the semiconductor industry, in an attempt to build a U.S.-led closed production and supply chain cycle, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing, to maintain its position in the global chip manufacturing The United States, by introducing politicization, camping and weaponization into the semiconductor industry, attempts to build a closed production and supply chain cycle dominated by the United States, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.	yes
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	However, the U.S. "core tactics" against China with great fanfare, but also "hurt the enemy a thousand and lose eight hundred".	yes
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	Recently, the well-known U.S. chip manufacturing equipment supplier, Panarin Group, announced that the group will fire 1,300 full-time employees and plans to fire 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters due to the latest round of the ban on the export of chip manufacturing equipment to China.	yes
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	Global lithography giant Asmax Holdings of the Netherlands recently warned that a ban on exporting semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.	yes
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	U.S. media analysis, in the U.S. government on China's chip and semiconductor industries such as the implementation of brute force suppression, many U.S. companies are deeply hurt, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer fabrication equipment manufacturers, chip makers themselves, and so on.	yes
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	The United States so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry, but the global semiconductor industry chain, supply chain dragged down.	yes
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has long formed a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain.	yes
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	According to professional estimates, based on the specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products need to cross the borders of various countries more than 70 times, the whole process reaches 100 days.	no
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Despite the strong foundation of the U.S. semiconductor industry, it is weak in manufacturing capacity, especially in advanced process technology, and is heavily dependent on East Asia.	no
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	Even if the United States is trying to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the United States-led "small circle" regional development, but the global semiconductor industry related to the regional distribution and interdependence of the situation is difficult to be changed.	no
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The United States strongly "remodeling" "de-Chinaization" of the semiconductor industry chain, hitting the global semiconductor industry.	no
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	Chip is the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the joint participation of countries around the world.	no
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, the successive introduction of the "Innovation and Competition Act," "U.S. Competition Act of 2022," "Chip and Science Act," the use of scientific and technological hegemony, consolidate the country's leading edge in technology; allies, "Enwei and give" to induce Intel, TSMC, Samsung, and other chip manufacturers to set up factories in the U.S., and strive to ensure U.S. global leadership in the field of chips. Ensure the global leadership of the United States in the field of chips.	no
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	In the short term, the U.S. did create trouble and reap real benefits for the development of China's chip industry and related industries.	no
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	But in the long run, the United States hysterical suppression, forcing China's chip industry to continue to breakthrough, so that they have lost the huge Chinese market, and ultimately will greatly weaken the U.S. science and technology enterprises' willingness to innovate and innovation ability, damage the global chip industry development.	no

重阳问答︱如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Chongyang Q & A ︱ how to see the U.S. non-farm payrolls data in January greatly exceeded expectations and future trends - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website	yes
Q：请问重阳投资，如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势？	Q: May I ask Chongyang Investment, how do you think the U.S. January nonfarm payrolls data greatly exceeded expectations and the future trend?	yes
A：2月3日美国劳工部公布2023年1月非农就业数据，新增非农就业51.7万人，大幅高于市场预期的18.9万人；失业率降至3.4%，为近50年以来的最低位；时薪同比增速4.4%，环比增速0.3%，略有放缓。	A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released January 2023 nonfarm payrolls data, adding 517,000 nonfarm payrolls, sharply higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; hourly wages grew at a rate of 4.4% year-on-year, and at a slightly slower rate of 0.3% year-on-year.	yes
从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	From an aggregate perspective, this data has many one-time and technical factors of disturbance, such as the strike return of faculty and staff, the survey statistical caliber of the revision, the quarterly adjustment factor update, the follow-up may be revised (refer to the January 2022 new nonfarm payrolls from 504,000 downward revision to 364,000), nonfarm payrolls or not as strong as the data reflected.	yes
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	Structurally, the impact of layoffs in high-tech firms is still present but accounts for a relatively low percentage; new employment in high-touch service industries such as leisure and hospitality, education and health care has picked up sharply, and the data suggests that a labor gap in the service sector still exists.	yes
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Combined with the rebound in services PMI, job openings and labor gap data, which also greatly exceeded expectations, and the strength in consumer credit data, we judge that the U.S. services sector is in for a quick fix after the extreme weather and holiday season.	yes
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	In our view, it will be difficult to improve the supply-demand tension in the U.S. job market without going through a recession.	yes
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	There is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the U.S. labor market, and the labor force participation rate has been slow to move upward, especially for 25-54 year olds, who are already near their pre-epidemic highs.	yes
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	On top of that, the strength of consumer demand will contribute to a further lag in the impact of austerity on the job market, thanks to the excess savings of US residents and the strength of consumer credit.	yes
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	Continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be the undercurrent of the U.S. economy in 2023.	yes
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	Overlaying this with recurring inflation expectations as we now approach the end of the rate hike, we are not optimistic about a sustained decline in payroll growth.	no
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Prior to the release of this data, the U.S. stock, bond and currency markets were overly optimistic in their expectations for the Fed's path of interest rate hikes.	no
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	As inflation data continue to improve, the Fed in shortening the pace of interest rate hikes at the same time also continue to maintain the fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market is blind to the Fed's hawkish statement, not only expected to stop hiking early, but also expected to end the year two rate cuts.	no
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	With labor market supply and demand tight and the impact of austerity unclear, we believe that the Fed's year-end guidance for rate hikes is relatively reasonable, and that the adjustment of extreme market expectations and trading congestion may hurt the market somewhat.	no
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	Nevertheless, the stubbornness of the payroll growth rate is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with the M2 data turned negative year-on-year as well as the gradual turnaround of the leading indicators of the various CPI sub-items, the U.S. CPI data since October has turned to a rapid decline in the stage of the payroll growth rate of the stubborn will only be the formation of the bottom of the future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify the market in the next phase of the publication of the inflation data or enter a new round of games. A new round of games.	no

我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?

我当初购买的页面尺码选项为7c，8，9c，当时觉得这就是个陷阱，打电话给日亚中文客服，明确告知8就是8c，但是等商品回到中国才发现，只有8cm，我觉得这完全是故意设下的陷阱来坑中国人（按照亚马逊的售后），现在查看页面已没有这个选项。	I initially purchased the page size options for 7c, 8, 9c, at that time I think this is a trap, call Nichia Chinese customer service, clearly informed that 8 is 8c, but wait for the goods back to China only to find out that only 8cm, I think this is completely deliberately set up traps to pit Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales), and now check the page is no longer available for this option.	yes

我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	When I brought up the fact that the page for purchases is for confusing options like 7c, 8, 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me out by saying that the common Japanese codes don't come with a c like that, something like 140, but have you guys ever fucking looked at other caterpillar pages?	yes

这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	This logic I do not understand again, I am Japanese, I also want Chinese customer service, living in Japan, China does not need Chinese customer service, go to Japan tourists, do not have that effort to play the international long-distance, then the question comes, what people need to play the Amazon overseas purchase of Chinese phone, nothing like me, such as the Japanese Taoist.	no

轻便大容量	Lightweight and large capacity	yes
喜欢它轻便，开口大，就是两个独立的分隔袋对我来说有点多余，感觉不知道装什么好。	Love that it's lightweight and has a large opening, it's the two separate divider pockets that are a bit redundant for me, I feel like I don't know what to put in them.	yes

●整体来讲还算满意，24本很大一箱，很满足。	● Overall it was quite satisfying, 24 books in a very large box.	no
落寞的小狮子	Lonely Little Lion	yes
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	When I got the book, I thought it was going to be as simple as The Lost Corner, but it turns out there's a lot more text oops!	yes
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	It took three times to read the book to the kids, a little lion who shoots guns and loves Juicy Fudge.	yes
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	When I saw the lion eat the hunter this plot, the heart slightly uncomfortable, modern urban people for being eaten by animals such an arrangement is a bit unacceptable.	yes
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	By the end of the scene, the young lion, who has succeeded in human society, loses himself; he is no longer fully lion or fully human.	yes
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	In the end, there was only the back of the lion cub, wondering where he had gone.	yes
可能多年以后，这个小狮子的形象还留在长大了的小朋友的印象中，在某一天不经意的时候被想起，或许对她会有触动或是启发。	It is possible that years from now, the image of this lion cub will remain in the memory of a grown-up child, and will be recalled at an unspecified time one day, perhaps touching or inspiring her.	yes
性价比很高的作品集	A great portfolio for the money	yes
1、以前还不知道TASCHEN，最近买了不少他们的书，原因就是太强悍，不论是选题还是制作本身。	1, before I did not know TASCHEN, recently bought a lot of their books, the reason is too strong, both in the selection and the production itself.	yes
本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	There have been three editions of this work, the largest being close to 50 centimeters long by 34 centimeters wide, like that Michelangelo complete work; the middle edition is roughly 36 centimeters long by 23 centimeters wide; and this is the smallest, and comes with a book box for the two-volume book edition.	yes
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	Personally, I think it is acceptable, first, the price is cheap, and more than 700 pages are divided into two books, as a paperback is also better to flip; secondly, is different from the complete works of Michelangelo that book, paintings accounted for the main body, da Vinci this black and white manuscripts accounted for most of the limited budget, non-art professional readers, this edition as the appreciation of the paintings and manuscripts of the best price is the cost-effective.	yes
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	2, the narration of the painting part is great, with composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know if it's the printing or the book size, some of the shaded parts of the county are too deep to see the details, which is a bit of a pity.	yes
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	3. In contrast to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer.	yes
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius, and the latter's wide-ranging involvement and achievements are not enough to be described as genius.	yes
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	If before only looking at the paintings could only half experience Da Vinci, after reading the manuscript there is no language at all.	yes
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Garbage, whoever buys it regrets it!	yes
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	Never give bad reviews, this is truly garbage, bought a waste of money God, give a reason!	yes
1.走时不准，突然变成1月1号，时间归零了。	1. The timekeeping is not accurate, suddenly becomes January 1, the time is zeroed.	yes

6.不防水。	6. Not waterproof.	yes
7.其他。	7. Other.	yes
物流太慢	Logistics is too slow	yes
显示10月16号到，结果21号才收到，差评！	It showed that it arrived on October 16th, but it turned out to be received on the 21st... bad review!	yes
快递太差，亚马逊上买东西本来就慢，没想到会这么慢！	The delivery was terrible, buying on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow!	yes
总体满意	Overall satisfied	yes
之前一开始还担心相机的包装，这次还好，里面有充气包，相机三码一致，也能在官网注册，快门次数0，其余的就只能等时间检验了 。	Before at first I was worried about the packaging of the camera, this time it was fine, there is an inflatable bag inside, the camera three codes are consistent, also can be registered on the official website, the number of shutter count 0, the rest will have to wait for the test of time .	yes
发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	Shipping speed is quite fast, here to spit on the courier boy, valuable items on the concierge, go fast, I have no way to open the box in front of him to test, on this point is really speechless.	yes
商家发货前做到了为客户着想:)	The merchant did what was best for the customer before shipping :)	yes
商家比较负责，专门打电话问所用相机的屏幕尺寸，确实替客户着想了。	The merchant was more responsible and called specifically to ask about the size of the screen of the camera used, so he really looked out for the customer.	yes
发货速度也快。	Shipping was fast too.	yes
金刚膜贴上去也挺合适和管用的。	Adamantium film fits and works pretty well on it too.	yes
电池充不满	Battery not fully charged	yes
机器确实不错，想问下怎么第一次充电起就充不满啊，充电指示灯一直红色	The machine is really good, I would like to ask how to charge the first time from the charge is not enough ah, the charging indicator has been red	yes
目前找不到亚马逊官方反馈渠道，所以只能在商品评价里反馈	I can't find an official Amazon feedback channel at the moment, so I can only give feedback in the product reviews	yes
1. 在 3 月 29 号，通过预购途径使用 31 元购买了此书，显示 3 月 31 号会推送到设备上，此时亚马逊官网上还无法预览该书（因为还未发布）；	1. purchased the book through the pre-order route using $31 on March 29th, indicating that it would be pushed to devices on March 31st, at which point the book could not be previewed on the official Amazon site (because it had not yet been released);	yes
2. 3 月 31 号推送到设备上的书，内容是空白，只有敬请期待，而亚马逊上该书电子版降价到了 18 元；	2. the book that was pushed to devices on March 31st was blank, with only stay tuned, and the price of the electronic version of the book was reduced to $18 on Amazon;	yes
3. 这两天反复尝试将设备上的下载的空白的书进行删除，再次同步，都无法获取到包含实际内容的电子版《商业的本质》，但是看到亚马逊官网已经可以预览该书。	3. Repeated attempts over the past two days to delete the downloaded blank book from the device and synchronize it again have failed to obtain an electronic version of The Nature of Business that contains the actual content, but I see that the book can already be previewed on the Amazon website.	yes
目前我有几点感想	I have a few thoughts so far	yes
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	1. the price is not really the most important issue, the key is how to replace the blank books on kindle with books with actual content now, instead of downloading them forever with "stay tuned".	yes
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	2. Pre-ordered books should not be purchased in the future, after all, in case of jumping the gun, the procedure of downloading another book with empty content looks very complicated;	yes
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	3. I hope that Amazon will give a normal channel to give feedback on such issues, so that when there are doubts about the download of e-books, or the use of the e-books, there is a place to give feedback (work orders, online customer service can be, you can refer to the official Microsoft Store how to do)	yes
不是很推荐阅读	Not really recommended reading	yes
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it and write something about it from memory.	yes
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	This book is not so much a collection of short stories as it is a collection of pieces of life about love.	yes
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The tone of the book is extremely plain, the kind of plain as plain as plain water, the wordplay goes to the extreme of simplicity, and the plot is as silent and bland as a street on a summer afternoon.	yes
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Each short story is a snapshot of a small period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.	yes
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	Finally collected together under the title What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.	yes
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I think this collection of stories, and its title, is like a kind of performance art, the author wants to express that love is more than just the sadness and joy on the stage, the urban legend of the sea and the rocks, and not just you and me like glue, love is more than the above nor should it be represented by the above, love is also a life as plain as water, boring day by day, there is also the life of the unpreparedness, the reality of the escape, the future of the The future is uncertain.	yes
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	As you read this book your mind may go back to the bickering couple next to you, the tasteless marriages of people you know, and less-than-ideal relationships.	yes
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	This is exactly why I don't recommend reading it; aesthetically, the writing and plot of this book are tasteless, and unless your life is amazing or sweet as living in a candy castle, you'll have to read it with the feeling that you've seen it all and are bored.	yes
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	And in terms of depth of thought, the everyday episodes don't brighten or expand one's thoughts or horizons (unlike Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera in this regard), nor do the brief segments explore any questions, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?	yes
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	The breakdown of the protagonist's marriage stems from those reasons?	no
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much sense to read it or not.	no
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and genre than storyline, and is the reason why this book is a poorer reading experience.	no
适合粗读,不能细看。	Suitable for cursory reading, not for detailed reading.	yes
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	The book is logical, but not fleshed out enough.	yes
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	It explains a lot of the what and why of sales theory, but is very weak on how to do it, just pointing out the direction but not giving specific practices.	yes
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	Also, the book feels like a patchwork.	yes
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	Examples are both domestic and foreign; well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and unknowns.	yes
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	I don't know if the story was compiled for the sake of examples, but it would have been more convincing to cite some of the author's own cases.	yes
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	Change around on the title of customer or client.	yes
标题上还是顾客,正文中就变成客户了。	The headline is still a customer, but in the text it becomes a client.	yes
电子书中还出现了错别字、标点符号缺失、编号错误的问题。	The eBook also has typos, missing punctuation, and incorrect numbering.	yes
总之,这本书作为理论入门是个不错的选择,但对于已经从事销售工作想要提高销售水平的人就不太适用了。	In short, this book is a good choice as a theoretical introduction, but not so much for those who are already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales level.	yes
快速了解互联网金融的导读书	A quick introductory book on internet finance	yes
这本书很浅，可以说只是一个入门课，可以帮助大家快速了解互联网金融的全貌，但要深入了解，还是要按图索骥，自己去深挖。	This book is very shallow, and can be said to be only an introductory lesson to help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but to go deeper, you still have to follow the charts and dig deeper on your own.	yes
且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	And into the book time earlier, then Alipay WeChat borrow subsidies to cultivate user habits of the content has not been mentioned, today's share of third-party payments is afraid that the book is not so small as the proportion of it.	yes
现在好多人外出吃饭都是带个手机就好，商家也因为银行流水太高的原因，弃用银联了。	Nowadays, so many people just take a cell phone with them when they go out to eat, and merchants are abandoning the use of UnionPay because the bank flow is too high.	yes
但还是非常感谢作者写出这本入门书，看得出作者起码有多年的金融观察经验，对国内外的金融发展史都十分熟悉，所以才能写成如此通俗易懂的内容。	Still, I am very grateful to the author for writing this primer, and I can see that the author has at least many years of experience in financial observation, and is very familiar with the history of financial development both at home and abroad, which is why he has been able to write such an easy-to-understand content.	yes
写高大空很容易，难的是写的通俗易懂。	It's easy to write tall and empty, the hard part is writing in a way that is easy to understand.	yes
欣赏你，更想让你知道！	Appreciate you and want you to know it even more!	yes
决定一个人工作满意度的第一要素不是薪水高低，而是在工作中是否得到了足够重视和赏识。	The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether he or she is sufficiently valued and appreciated at work.	yes
根据马斯洛需求层次理论，在人的基本生存需要得到满足后，最迫切的就是心理需要的满足——希望被理解、被肯定、被赏识。	According to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory, after a person's basic survival needs have been satisfied, the most urgent is the fulfillment of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed and appreciated.	yes
确实，对于国人来说，大部分是“爱你在心口难开”，即便是怀有爱、感激与赞赏也是默默放在心里不会说出来。	Indeed, for most of the people in the country, "love you in the heart of the mouth is difficult to open", even with love, gratitude and appreciation is silently put in the heart will not say out.	yes
作者在本书中阐述了五种赞赏的语言：肯定的言辞、精心时刻、服务的行为、称心的礼物、身体接触。	In this book, the author describes five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, moments of care, acts of service, gifts of gratification, and physical touch.	yes
我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	I think the important thing is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation really are, but that you can use them from the heart at all times to appreciate and be grateful for those around you, whether they are family, friends or coworkers.	yes
其实越是亲密的人越需要赞赏和感恩，这样我们的生活才会变得更加美好。	In fact, the closer we are to each other, the more we need to appreciate and be thankful for our lives.	yes
学会赞赏，企业也能在一定程度上挽留住人才，降低辞职率。	By learning to appreciate, companies can also retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.	yes
感谢译者给我们带来了精彩的国外的思想和世界。	Thank you to the translators for bringing us wonderful ideas and worlds from abroad.	yes
由于中西方文化背景等原因，语言之间或多或少会存在差异，如果有机会能看到作者原版相信会收获更多。	Due to the Chinese and Western cultural background and other reasons, there will be more or less differences between the languages, if you have the opportunity to see the author's original version I believe it will gain more.	yes
再次谢谢作者和译者以及编辑们的辛勤劳动！	Thanks again to the authors and translators and editors for their hard work!	no
疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	Suspected shoddy goods, ask Amazon for strict scrutiny	yes
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	Super poor quality, loose packaging, no weight, not even as good as roadside stall products, no grams, no bar code, ten bags of packaging is also loose, not at all the characteristics of qualified products; is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, has applied for a return; completely belongs to the quality of the problem; suggest that businessmen shine their eyes and refuse inferior goods; add: bought another heart to heart, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 rolls, added a few comparative photos, further verified the product's shoddy, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid financial losses and further mood upset!	yes
再度期望亚马逊能够一丝不苟，严把商品源头。	Once again, I expect Amazon to be meticulous and tighten up the source of their merchandise.	yes
马马虎虎的产品，和期望有差距	Sloppy product, falls short of expectations	yes
优点：	Pros:	yes
1. 大品牌，价格便宜。	1. Big brands at cheap prices.	yes
优点2：电机和刀片都是PANASONIC保证的，使用起来也还OK，但是和我期望有差距。	Pro 2: The motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they work OK, but they are not what I expected.	yes
缺点：	Drawbacks:	yes
1. 充电没有指示灯，这个最基本你的电源指示都省下了，估计购买300元产品的客户，在松下PANASONIC的眼里，也是施舍，毫无尊重。	1. Charging no indicator light, this most basic your power instructions are saved, it is estimated that the purchase of 300 yuan product customers, in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC, but also alms, no respect.	yes

和我之前用过的同价位的飞利浦PHILIPS相比，虽然多了个刀头，但是松下这款产品，质量真是对不起消费者了。	Compared to my previous Philips PHILIPS in the same price range, although it has an extra blade, this Panasonic product, the quality is really sorry for the consumer.	yes
小包装	small package	yes
收到快递一看上面写着电商版就知道又掉坑里了，比超市买的小了好些，应该是M，跟商品介绍上面的图片包装不一样，所谓新版吧。	Received the courier a look at the above written electric version know and fell into the pit, than the supermarket to buy a good deal smaller, should be M, with the introduction of goods above the picture packaging is not the same, the so-called new version of it.	yes
三颗星是怪自己马虎没看清楚商品规格，你卖M码电商版我没意见，你货不对版是几个意思？	Three stars is to blame for being sloppy and not reading the item specs, I have no problem with you selling a size M e-commerce version, what do you mean the item is not the right size?	yes
电商套路深，有时间还是去超市买了。	The e-commerce set is deep, so I'd better go to the supermarket to buy it sometime.	yes
就酱紫。	That's it.	yes
味道不喜欢	I don't like the taste.	yes
小孩很不喜欢牙膏的味道，每次都说辣，也许用别的词形容才更贴切，小孩的词库里暂时只有这个词。	The kid hates the taste of toothpaste and says spicy every time, so maybe another word would be more apt, and that's all that's in the kid's vocabulary for now.	yes
搞活动时候买的，很便宜，所以也不好意思给差评了，四星吧，不过不会再买了。	I bought it during an event and it was cheap, so I'm sorry to give a bad review, 4 stars, but I won't buy it again.	yes
正品哟 包装好	It's the real thing. It's well packaged.	yes
包装很完整，里面加了充气袋，没有网上评论的只有光秃秃一个产品的样子。	The packaging was complete with an inflatable bag added to it, and it didn't look like just a bare product as reviewed online.	yes
瓶子外包装上还有一层塑料膜像图片上描述的一样，快递也很快，拍下第二天就来了。	There is a plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle like described in the picture, and the delivery was fast, came the next day after I took the picture.	yes

糟心的一次购物体验	A bad shopping experience	yes
黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	Black Friday when the order, the results of waiting for a long time are not received, the back of a query, the package has long been signed for, asked around the colleagues said did not help to sign for it, hurry to contact the courier company, but said that the sender can only initiate the query, contacted Amazon customer service, and waited for more than ten days, and finally figure out is the courier was mistakenly thrown to someone else, and then a few times turnover to finally pick up the courier, the outer packaging has been torn down, the commodity is also a kind of complete, I do not know whether it has been used, in short, quite bad!	yes
错误的配图	Incorrect Matching Picture	yes
我以为自己能够收到图1这样的耳机，没想到却收到了图2这样的耳机，图物不一致也就算了，耳机左右声音大小不一又是什么意思？	I thought I was able to receive headphones like Figure 1, but I didn't expect to receive headphones like Figure 2, and the inconsistency of the figure and object is not even, what is the point of the headphones having different sound sizes on the left and right?	yes
虽然名称都是一样的，但还是希望大家能够小心注意，另外还请亚马逊负责人及时更换正确的配图，万分感谢。	Even though the names are the same, I hope you can pay careful attention to it, and I also ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct matching image in time, thank you very much.	yes
操作系统一般般	The operating system is mediocre	yes
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	Used for a period of time, the overall picture is okay, do not feel any difference, it is the system let people look at the tangled, boot time is obviously a little slow, can not make a good setup, and then with the software is no need to comment on, the response speed that is more general, and colleagues compared to the home that is not an order of magnitude.	yes
看评论说很人性化的设计，我没有找到哪里人性化，遥控器这个常用的上下左右，返回键设计的位置实在是不敢恭维。	Read the reviews say very user-friendly design, I did not find where user-friendly, remote control this commonly used up and down, right and left, back button design location is really not complimentary.	yes
所以呢，就当个电视吧，再外加电视盒之类的用吧。	So what, just use it as a TV, plus a TV box or something.	yes
降价太厉害了	The price drop is too much.	yes
降价太厉害了，一百多入现在99！	The price drop is so great, over a hundred into now 99!	yes
在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	I've accumulated a lot of unreviewed orders at Amazon, so I've standardized on a copied paragraph as the review content.	yes
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I were to rate it with this paragraph, it would mean that this product is at least an 85 or higher.	yes
而比较差的产品，我绝对不会偷懒到复制粘贴评价，这样其他消费者在购买的时候会作为参考，而商家也会因此改进商品质量。	And for the worse products, I would never be lazy enough to copy and paste the reviews so that other consumers would use them as a reference when purchasing and the business would improve the quality of the item as a result.	yes
低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	Low price for a good cable, this is enough without audiophiles!	yes
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	Such a cheap line, but it should be up to the hdmi certification standards, personal comparison kill domestic Akihabara these shit (the price is twice as expensive), the line body is thick, but also relatively soft, 7 meters of transmission without noise, the future of low-priced line recognized by the Bess!	yes
东西还可以，但是亚马逊的售后服务真的比其他网站差太多了	The stuff is okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really way worse than other sites	yes
下单后发现下错了，但是取消订单已经取消不了，网页联系在线客服一直显示错误链接，联系不上。	After placing an order, I found that I had placed a wrong order, but I couldn't cancel it anymore, and the webpage contacted online customer service and kept displaying an incorrect link, so I couldn't get in touch with them.	yes

我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I used to buy items that can't be returned on policy in both Jingdong and Suning, including milk, diapers, etc., and contacted customer service to return them, and the diapers from Jingdong smelled too much after opening them contacted customer service to return them as usual to you Amazon can't.	yes
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	Rules are dead, people are alive. Contact your customer service, how did it go?	yes
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	Telling me that I either have to take it myself or have the delivery person buy it themselves, and it's not easy enough for the delivery person, so who am I to make them pay for something they didn't purchase themselves?	yes

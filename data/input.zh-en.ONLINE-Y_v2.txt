如果我们发觉本手册页的内容由于过时而导致明显的混乱和抱怨时,我们就停止发布它.不可能有其他选择,象更新Info文件同时更新 man 手册, 因为其他维护 Gnu cc 的工作没有留给我们时间做这个.GNU 工程认为 man 手册是过时产物, 应该把时间用到别的地方.	If we notice obvious confusion and complaints about the content of this manual page due to its obsolescence, we stop publishing it. There is no other option, such as updating the Info file and updating the man manual at the same time, since other tasks to maintain Gnu cc don't leave us time to do this.

描述 (DESCRIPTION) C 和 C++ 编译器是集成的.他们都要用四个步骤中的一个或多个处理输入文件: 预处理(preprocessing), Hii(compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking) .	DESCRIPTION (DESCRIPTION) The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They all process the input files in one or more of the four steps: preprocessing (preprocessing), Hii (assembly), (assembly), and (assembly) MERE (linking).	yes
源文件后级名标识源文件的语言, 但是对编译器来说, 后绥名控制着缺省设定:	The subname of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the last name controls the default settings:	yes
gcc 认为预处理后的文件(.i) 是 c 文件, 并且设定 c 形式的连接，	gcc believes that the preprocessed file (.i) is a c file, and establishes a c-form connection,	yes
g++ 认为预处理后的文件 (.i) 是 c++ 文件 ,并且设定 c++ 形式的连接.	g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C++ file, and establishes a c++-style connection.	yes

.h 预处理器文件; 通常不出现在命令行上其他后级名的文件被传递给连接器 (Linker).通常包括:	.h preprocessor files; files that do not usually appear on the command line by other suffixes are passed to the connector (Linker). This usually includes:	no
.0 目标文件 (Object file)	.0 object file (Object file)	no
.a 归档库文件(Archive file)	.a archive file (Archive file)	no
除非使用了 -cec，-s, 或 -E 选项(或者编译错误阻止了完整的过程),否则连接总是最后的步骤.	Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the full process), connecting is always the last step.	no
在连接阶段中,所有对应于源程序的.e 文件，-1 库文件, 无法识别的文件名(包括指定的.o H 标文件和 .a 库文件)按命令行中的顺序传递给连接器选项 (OPTIONS)	In the connection phase, all the.e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognized file names (including the specified.o H label files and.a library files) are passed to the connector options (OPTIONS) in the order in the command line	no
选项必须分立给出 : de ' 完全不同于 `-d -r '.	The options must be given separately: de 'is completely different from `-d -r'.	no
大多数 ` -=E :和 `-W' 选项有两个相反的格式 : -fname 和 -fno-name (或 -Wname 和 -Wno- name).	Most of the `-=E: and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno- name).	no
这里只列举不是默认选项的格式.	Only formats that are not default options are listed here.	no
下面是所有选项的摘要, 按类型分组, 解释放在后面的章节中.	Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in later sections.	no
代码生成选项 (Code Generation Option)	Code Generation Option (Code Generation Option)	yes
总体选项 (Overall Option)	Overall Option	yes
明确指出后面输入文件的语言为 language (而不是从文件名后绥得到的默认选择).	Make it clear that the language of the next input file is language (not the default choice obtained from the file name).	yes
这个选项应用于后面所有的输入文件, 直到遇着下一个 `-x' 选项 .language 的可选	This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option.language option is selected	yes
关闭任何对语种的明确说明, 因此依据文件名后级处理后面的文件 RE AS E ` -x' 选项).	Close any explicit language specification, so post-process the following file according to the file name (RE AS E '-x' option).	yes
如果只操作四个阶段( 预处理, 编译, 汇编, 连接)中的一部分, 可以使用 ` -x' 选项 (或文件名后 Ah) 告诉 geo 从哪里开始,用 `~-c' ，`-s' ,或 `-E' 选项告诉 geo 到哪里结束.注意,某些选项组合 (例如 ，`-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c 编译或汇编源文件, ETER. ERA ATI 缺省情况下， GCC 通过用 ` .o' 蔡换源文件名后级 ` .ec 标文件名. 可以使用-o 选项选择其他名字.GCC忽略 -ec 选项后面任何无法识别的输入文伯 -S F 何事情.	If you're only operating part of the four stages (preprocessing, compilation, assembly, connection), you can use the '-x' option (or Ah after the file name) to tell geo where to start, use the `~-c', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note, some combination of options (for example, `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compiles or assembles the source file, ETER. By default ERA ATI, GCC uses' .o 'Tsai to replace the source file name with a suffix of' .ec 'for the file name. You can choose a different name using the -o option. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the -ec option, Wimber -S F, whatever.	yes
了的目标文件.	The target file is ready.	yes
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	Once compiled, it stops; no assembly is carried out.	yes
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	Pipelines rather than temporary files are used to work between the different stages of the compilation process, since those systems' assemblers can't read data from pipes. The GNU assembler doesn't have this problem. The assembler can accept the C “dialect”: supports C programs that conform to ANSI standards.	yes
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This will turn off some feature keywords in GNU Cc that aren't compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, which indicate that they are popular and rarely used, as well as disabling (note: all standard libraries are available in the hosted environment (hosted environment), and the function returns an int value for almost every program other than the kernel. The typical example is almost every program other than the kernel. The corresponding independent environment (f£) (Reestanding environment) There is no standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main. The most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, see recent information on the GCC website)	yes
对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	Function declarations with no arguments, such as `int foo (); ', are treated in C style --- that is, the number or type of parameters is not specified. (For C++ only).	no
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	Under normal circumstances, a function like this foo in C++ means that the parameter is empty.	no
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	The list of sections has been removed from here to some aspects that attempt to support the traditional C compiler.	no
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	See the NU c manual for details; we've removed the details so that when the content is out of date, people won't be HERI.	no
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the '-traditional' option has an added effect, allowing values to be assigned to this.	no
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	It has the same effect as the '-ethis-is-variable' option.	no
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional CC preprocessor.	no
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	In particular, what is mentioned above about preprocessors is not included, but the other effects of the `-traditional' option are not included.	no
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the '$' character in identifiers (for C++ only).	no
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	You can specify the `"-efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly disallow the use of the '$' character.	no
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	(GNU C++ allows the '$' character by default on some target systems, but not all systems.)	no
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of ant types to enumerated types (enumeration) (MEF c++).	no
正常情况下 GNU C++ 允许从 enum 到 int 的转换,反之则不行.	Under normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int; the reverse is not possible.	no
-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	-fexternal-—templates generates smaller code (c++ only) for template declarations (template declarations) by generating a copy of each template function (template function) only where they are defined.	no
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	To successfully use this option, you must mark either `#pragma implementation tatio' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (statement) in all files using the template.	no
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	When a program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', all template instantiations (template instantiations) are external types. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.	no
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	This can be achieved through typedef, which refers to every instance required.	no
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	Correspondence, if the default option `-fno-exteznal-templates' is used at compile time, all template instances are explicitly set as built-in.	no
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All member functions (with the exception of constructor subfunctions and the mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class in which they belong.	no
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	This doesn't indicate that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.	no
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; at this point, it is called directly.	no
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch allows the types of the second and third parameters of the conditional expression to not match.	no
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	The value of this type of expression is Void. -fthis-—is-variable allows assigning values to this (for c++ only).	no
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	Incorporating a user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++ makes the “this” that can be assigned a value seem out of place.	no
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	Therefore, by default, assigning a value to this from within a class member function is an invalid operation.	no
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	However, for backwards compatibility, you can make this operation effective with the `-fthis-is-variable' option.	no
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	-funsigned-char defines a char as an unsigned type, just like an unsigned char.	no
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Every machine has its own default char type. It could be either an unsigned char or a signed char.	no
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	Ideally, when relying on the symbolic nature of the data, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz.	no
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	But many programs have been written using only a simple char, and the expectation street is a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine that wrote the program).	no
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This option, and its antonym, makes such programs work on the corresponding default values.	no
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	The type of char should always be clearly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it represents exactly one of them.	no
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	If no 'signed' or “unsigned” modifiers are explicitly stated, these options are used to define a signed bitfield (bitfield) or an unsigned bitfield.	no
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	By default, bitfields are signed, since the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed numbers; however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, the bitfields are always unsigned numbers.	no
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	-fwritable-strings stores string constants in a writable data section without any special treatment.	no
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	This is to be compatible with some old programs; their calculation of string constants is a very bad idea, and the '-traditional' option has the same effect.	no

2008年经济危机后，一些吸毒者开始寻找更便宜的合成物质，使用模式转向注射毒品。	After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began searching for cheaper synthetic substances and switched their usage pattern to injecting drugs.	no
与此同时，各国政府削减了与毒品相关的预算。	At the same time, governments have cut drug-related budgets.	no
如果各国政府以同样的方式应对当前的经济衰退，预防吸毒和相关风险行为等干预措施和戒毒治疗服务可能会受到沉重打击。	If governments respond in the same way to the current economic downturn, interventions to prevent drug use and related risk behaviors and drug treatment services could be hit hard.	no
此外，拦截行动和国际合作的优先性可能会降低，使贩运者更容易行动。	Furthermore, interdiction operations and international cooperation may be given less priority, making it easier for traffickers to act.	no
一些国家有大量毒品通过商业航班走私，预计这些国家的贩毒活动受到的直接影响最大。	A number of countries have large amounts of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and drug trafficking activities in these countries are expected to be the most directly affected.	no
有信使将甲基苯丙胺等合成毒品放在随身背包或藏在私人行李中携带，有时数量很大。由于几乎各地都对航空客运实施了限制，利用商业航空旅行供应毒品的活动可能会完全中断。	Couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. As restrictions on air passenger traffic are imposed almost everywhere, activities using commercial air travel to supply drugs may be completely interrupted.	no
尽管国际邮政供应链也受到了干扰，但利用暗网和货物邮寄进行贩运的活动可能会增加。	Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, the use of the dark web and the mailing of goods for trafficking is likely to increase.	no
从长远来看，经济衰退和相关的封闭措施可能会打乱毒品市场。	In the long run, the economic downturn and associated lockdown measures could disrupt the drug market.	no
由于不断上升的失业率和缺乏机会，贫困和弱势人群将更有可能以有害的方式吸毒，患上吸毒病症，并转向与毒品有关的非法活动一无论是生产还是运输。	Due to rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug addiction disorders, and switch to illegal drug-related activities, whether production or transportation.	no
贩毒组织可能会利用这种情况，向脆弱人群提供服务，并招募新成员来壮大队伍。	Drug cartels may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable people and recruit new members to grow their ranks.	no
随着政府应对能力的降低，这些转变可能会快速扎根，成为许多社区的新现实。	As the government's ability to respond declines, these changes are likely to quickly take root and become a new reality for many communities.	no
扩张与复杂性	Expansion and Complexity	no
市场增长	Market growth	no
人口增长模式部分解释了市场扩张的原因	The population growth pattern partly explains the reasons for market expansion	no
世界各地的吸毒现象一直在增多，无论是从总体数字还是从吸毒者在世界人口中所占比例来看都是如此。	Drug use has been increasing all over the world, both in terms of overall numbers and in terms of the proportion of drug users in the world population.	no
2009年估计吸毒者有2.1亿人，占全球15-64岁人口的4.8%,而2018年估计吸毒者有2.69亿人，占这类人口的5.3%。	In 2009, there were an estimated 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, while the estimated number of drug users in 2018 was 269 million, accounting for 5.3% of this population.	no
在过去二十年期间，发展中国家吸毒情况的增长速度远远快于发达国家。	Over the past two decades, drug use in developing countries has grown far faster than developed countries.	no
这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。	This partly reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but it also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.	no
青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。	Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.	no
在2000-2018年期间，发展中国家这一年龄段的人口增长了16%,而发达国家这一年龄段的人口减少了10%。	Between 2000 and 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries declined by 10%.	no
1城市化是当前和未来毒品市场的一个驱动因素	1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets	no
无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。	In both developed and developing countries, there is more drug use in urban areas than in rural areas.	no
吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。	The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the large-scale movement of people from rural to urban1 Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.	no
城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。	Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, particularly in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.	no
财富的增加与吸毒情况增多相联，但承受疾病负担最大的是最贫穷的人在世界范围内，发达国家的吸毒情况比发展中国家更为普遍。	Increased wealth is linked to increased drug use, yet the poorest people bear the greatest burden of disease worldwide, and drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.	no
可卡因之类的毒品更是与世界上较富裕的地区联系较为牢固。	Drugs such as cocaine are even more strongly linked to the wealthiest regions of the world.	no
同样，在各国内部，社会富裕阶层的吸毒流行率较高。	Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the affluent sectors of society.	no
但转为吸毒病症的比率较高的却是社会经济地位较低的人。	However, those with lower socioeconomic status have a higher rate of conversion to drug addiction.	no
来自少数几个国家的数据表明，有害的吸毒模式与病症同低收入之间存在联系。	Data from a few countries suggest a link between harmful drug use patterns and illness and low income.	no
这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。	These patterns seem to be less common in the more affluent social classes.	no
全球新冠肺炎危机造成的经济制约很可能会加剧包括吸毒者在内的最弱势群体的风险。	The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to heighten the risks of the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.	no
例如，劳动力市场的变化，如失业率上升，过去一直与吸毒情况的增加有关，而这场疫情己经迫使全球数千万人失业。	For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked to increased drug use in the past, and the pandemic has already forced tens of millions of people around the world to lose their jobs.	no
新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。	COVID-19 may cause the drug market to expand further. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause more farmers to increase or engage in illegal crop cultivation, or because of reduced control capacity of national authorities, or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities under the economic crisis.	no
新冠肺炎的相关限制措施导致空中和陆路交通减少，海上贩运可能已经因此而增加，海上的拦截风险低，而且比空中或陆路走私的数量更多。	The restrictions associated with COVID-19 have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, and maritime trafficking may have increased as a result. The risk of interception at sea is low, and there is more volume than air or land smuggling.	no
最近已有报告称可卡因货物直接从南美经由海路运往欧洲。	There have been recent reports of cocaine shipments directly from South America to Europe by sea.	no
复杂性增强	Increased complexity	yes
非国际管制物质的出现情况稳定，但有潜在危害的新型类阿片正在增多毒品市场正日趋复杂。	The emergence of substances not under international control is stable, but potentially harmful novel opioid types are increasing, and the drug market is becoming increasingly complex.	yes
除大麻、可卡因和海洛因等植物类物质之外，已经增添了数百种合成毒品，其中许多并不在国际管制之下。药品的非医疗使用也快速增多。	In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. Non-medical use of pharmaceuticals is also rapidly increasing.	yes
会员国的国内市场每年约有500种新型活性物质。	Member States' domestic markets have around 500 novel active substances each year.	yes
目前其中大多是兴奋剂，其次是合成的大麻素受体激动剂和少量的类阿片。	Currently, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid agonists and small amounts of opioids.	yes
虽然新型精神活性物质的总体数量已经稳定下来，但比例发生了变化。	Although the overall amount of novel psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.	yes
在2014年确定的新型精神活性物质种类总数中，类阿片新型精神活性物质仅占2%,但到2018年，这一数字己上升至9%。	Novel opioid psychoactive substances accounted for only 2% of the total number of novel psychoactive substances identified in 2014, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.	yes
类阿片新型精神活性物质中有许多是芬太尼的类似物，其药效和危害已得到证明，在北美导致了过量死亡事件，其他区域也有，但程度较轻。	Many of the novel opioid psychoactive substances are fentanyl analogues. Their efficacy and harm have been proven to have caused overdose deaths in North America, as well as in other regions, but to a lesser extent.	yes
在北美，芬太尼有的用作海洛因和其他毒品（包括可卡因和甲基苯丙胺）的掺杂剂，有的用来制造假冒的药用类阿片。	In North America, some fentanyl is used as a doping agent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, while others are used to make counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.	yes
一些证据表明，欧洲也有注射新型精神活性物质兴奋剂的现象：一项对欧洲六个城市废弃注射器残留物的研宄发现，许多注射器都沾有产生兴奋作用的新型精神活性物质》	Some evidence suggests that Europe also has the phenomenon of doping with novel psychoactive substances: a study on the residues of abandoned syringes in six European cities found that many syringes contained novel psychoactive substances with stimulatory effects.”	yes
2新型精神活性物质的使用可能会逐渐牢固存在于弱势群体中	2 The use of novel psychoactive substances may gradually become entrenched in vulnerable groups	no
单一种类的新型精神活性物质几乎从未形成大的市场。	A single class of novel psychoactive substances has almost never formed a large market.	no
但来自欧洲的证据表明，合成大麻素在无家可归者和监狱囚犯等社会边缘群体中是一个严重的问题。	But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as homeless people and prison inmates.	no
有22个国家报告了监狱中使用新型精神活性物质的情况，其中大多数国家将合成大麻素确定为主要挑战。	Twenty-two countries reported on the use of novel psychoactive substances in prisons, most of which identified synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.	no
对前体化学品的管制迫使制毒者进行创新最常作为前体用来合成苯丙胺、甲基苯丙胺和“摇头丸”等毒品的许多化学品已被置于国际管制之下。	Control of precursor chemicals forces drug makers to innovate Many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and “ecstasy” have been placed under international control.	no
贩毒者和制毒者一直在寻找替代品一不仅有管制较松的物质，还有专门为规避管制而设计的化学品，即所谓的“特制前体”。	Drug traffickers and drug producers are always looking for alternatives, not only less controlled substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to evade control, so-called “special precursors.”	no
旨在阻止新冠肺炎传播的限制性措施很可能使依赖前体化学品的制毒者受到进一步挤压。	Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug makers that rely on precursor chemicals.	no
来自墨西哥的证据表明，这已经成为 现实：据报告，2020年3月，从东亚进口的甲基苯丙胺前体短缺促使墨西哥和美国的甲基苯丙胺价格上涨。	Evidence from Mexico suggests this is already a reality: in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia reportedly prompted a rise in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the US.	no
市场瞬息万变	The market is changing rapidly	no
合成药物在中亚和俄罗斯联邦取代阿片剂	Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation	no
中亚和俄罗斯联邦的阿片剂市场在2008年至2018年期间似乎发生了变化。	The opiates market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.	no
俄罗斯联邦当局截获的阿片剂数量下降了约80%，同时因使用类阿片而接受治疗的人数大幅减少。	The number of opiates intercepted by Russian authorities has dropped by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has been drastically reduced.	no
但兴奋剂市场却似乎日渐兴旺。	But the doping market seems to be booming.	no

结晶甲基苯丙胺已经成为“芬乃他林”和曲马多之外又一种令人担忧的主要药物。	Crystalline methamphetamine has become another worrisome major drug other than “fennethalin” and tramadol.	no
2015年的一项研宄进一步证实了这些发现，吸毒者表示大麻比“芬乃他林”或甲基苯丙胺更难获得。	A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users saying marijuana is harder to obtain than “fennethalin” or methamphetamine.	no
最近，伊拉克当局发现了多个甲基苯丙胺加工点，麻管局已对伪麻黄碱制剂的大批进口表示关切一甲基苯丙胺加工点将这些制剂用作前体。	Recently, the Iraqi authorities discovered multiple methamphetamine processing sites, and the Board has expressed concern over the massive import of pseudoephedrine preparations using these agents as precursors at a methamphetamine processing site.	no
在阿富汗，甲基苯丙胺制造似乎始于2014年。	In Afghanistan, methamphetamine production appears to have started in 2014.	no
自那时起，甲基苯丙胺的缉获量一直在稳步上升。	Since then, there has been a steady rise in methamphetamine seizures.	no
但2019年上半年的缉获量一^657公斤——与上一年相比大幅骤增。	But the amount seized in the first half of 2019 was 1,^657 kg — a sharp increase from the previous year.	no
在其他国家大量缉获了据认为源自阿富汗的甲基苯丙胺，这也表明该国的产量正在迅速上升。	Large amounts of methamphetamine believed to have originated in Afghanistan have been seized in other countries, which also indicates that the country's production is rising rapidly.	no
政策变化和变化趋势	Policy changes and changing trends	yes
非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域大多有大麻使用增多的趋势	Most of the jurisdictions that have legalized the non-medical use of marijuana have a trend of increasing marijuana use	yes
加拿大、乌拉圭和美国的11个法域允许制造大麻产品供非医疗使用。	Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay, and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.	yes
在其中多数法域，大麻使用自合法化以来有所增多，尽管在其他未将非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域也观察到了同样的趋势。	Cannabis use has increased in most of these jurisdictions since legalization, although similar trends have been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical use of marijuana.	yes
在美国最早通过立法的两个州科罗拉多州和华盛顿州，成年人非医疗使用大麻的情况增加，特别是过去一个月以及每天或几乎每天使用的情况增多，自2012年起便已超过了全国平均水平。	In Colorado and Washington, the first two states to pass legislation in the US, there has been an increase in non-medical use of marijuana among adults, particularly over the past month and the increase in daily or almost daily use, which has surpassed the national average since 2012.	yes
所有指标都显示，自2011年以来，乌拉圭的大麻使用情况有所增加，上月使用情况几乎翻了一番。	All indicators show that cannabis use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, almost doubling last month.	yes
这表明增加的主要原因是经常和频繁使用大麻。	This indicates that the increase is mainly due to the frequent and frequent use of marijuana.	yes
加拿大的短期数据也表明，2018年至2019年合法市场扩大的同时，使用量也在增加。	Canada's short-term data also shows that while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage also increased.	yes
然而，2019年仍有40%的大麻使用者靠非法来源获得某些产品。	However, 40% of cannabis users still obtained certain products from illegal sources in 2019.	yes
全球大麻药草缉获量暴跌的背后原因是大麻合法化？	Is the reason behind the sharp drop in global cannabis herb seizures the legalization of marijuana?	yes
2018年，全球大麻药草缉获量降至20年来的最低水平，这是因为北美的缉获量下降，在过去10年中下降了 84%。	In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years due to declining seizures in North America, which fell 84% over the past 10 years.	no
相比之下，同期世界其他地区的缉获量几乎翻了一番。缉获的模式表明，旨在放开大麻市场的政策在下降中发挥了关键作用。	By contrast, the volume of seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period. Seizure patterns suggest that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.	no
对新型精神活性物质的监管似乎有遏制作用在国内对新型精神活性物质的监管效果仍然很难评估。	The regulation of novel psychoactive substances appears to have a curbing effect. It is still difficult to evaluate the effects of domestic regulation of novel psychoactive substances.	no

获取药用类阿片的障碍与许多因素有关，包括立法、文化、卫生系统和处方做法。	Barriers to access to medicinal opioids are linked to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescription practices.	no
较贫穷的人患吸毒病症的风险更大2018年约有3,560万人患有吸毒病症。	Poorer people are at greater risk of developing drug addiction disorders. In 2018, about 35.6 million people had drug addiction conditions.	no
贫困、有限的教育和社会边缘化可能会增加吸毒病症风险，并加剧其后果。高收入国家的研宄证实了这一点，在这些研究中，个人不利的社会经济轨迹一不仅仅是他们在某一时间点的状况一也与吸毒病症风险有关。	Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use diseases and exacerbate their consequences. Studies from high-income countries confirm this. In these studies, an individual's unfavorable socio-economic trajectory is not only related to their condition at a certain point in time, but also to the risk of drug addiction symptoms.	no
吸毒病症还会加深社会经济劣势，进一步增加失业、贫困和无家可归的风险，从而助长劣势的恶性循环。这些结果也可能与刑事司法系统内的侮辱性态度和后果有关。	Drug addiction also deepens socio-economic disadvantages and further increases the risk of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby fueling a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These results may also be related to abusive attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.	no
妇女、少数民族和移民、性取向多样化群体、因武装冲突或灾难而流离失所的人以及农村环境中的人也可能受到吸毒病症的过重影响，或者在获得治疗服务方面遇到问题。	Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, sexually diverse groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug use or have problems accessing treatment services.	no
根据估计因残疾和过早死亡而损失的健康寿命年数的残疾调整寿命年（DALY)指标，在过去10年中，有害的吸毒对范围更广的社会影响加重。	According to the Disability-Adjusted Life Span (DALY) index, which estimates the number of years of healthy life expectancy lost due to disability and premature death, the impact of harmful drug use on a wider range of societies has worsened over the past 10 years.	no

毒品和暴力之间的关系错综复杂很难确定精神活性物质的使用和暴力之间的所有因果关系。	The complex relationship between drugs and violence makes it difficult to determine all the causal relationships between psychoactive substance use and violence.	no
全球范围的有限数据表明，迷醉可能是杀人的一个重要因素。	Limited data from around the world suggest that intoxication may be a significant factor in homicides.	no
但在暴力事件中，酒精的作用似乎比毒品更大。	But alcohol appears to play a greater role than drugs in violent incidents.	no
虽然吸毒可能会导致犯罪，但在某些情况下，这种联系可以部分归因于多种中介因素，如社会经济劣势以及由个人风险、家庭环境和同龄人影响造成的其他类型的逆境。	Although drug use may lead to crime, in some cases this link may be due in part to a variety of mediating factors, such as socio-economic disadvantages and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.	no
贩毒和暴力之间的联系是多方面的。	The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.	no
如果已有稳定的犯罪结构，包括国际贩毒在内的大规模有组织犯罪活动有可能在无暴力的情况下实施。	If there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, is likely to be carried out without violence.	no
短期内，暴力的存在和程度与其说取决于贩运的数量，不如说取决于造成有组织犯罪集团之间力量平衡不稳定的某些变化，例如非法市场规模的变化，知名罪犯的死亡或监禁，以及使一个集团弱于另一个集团的执法措施。	In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depends not so much on the amount of trafficking as on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of illegal markets, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.	no
最新趋势	The latest trends	yes
吸毒大麻是最常用的物质，类阿片危害最大	Drug use of marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most harmful	yes
据估计，2018年使用大麻的有 1.92 亿人，使之成为全球使用最多的毒品。	It is estimated that 192 million people used marijuana in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.	yes
相比之下，2018年使用类阿片的有5,800万人。	By contrast, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.	yes
但阿片类药物的相关危害却因使用者较少而受到忽视。	However, the harms associated with opioids have been ignored due to fewer users.	yes
在2017年与吸毒病症有关的估计167,000例死亡中，有66%是这类物质造成的，在据信为吸毒导致的残疾或过早死亡而损失的2,100万年寿命中，有50%是这类物质造成的。	Of the estimated 167,000 deaths associated with drug use conditions in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and 50% of the 21 million years of life believed to have been lost due to disability or premature death due to drug use were caused by these substances.	yes
合成类阿片的非医疗使用加剧了公共卫生危机	Non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis	yes
在西非、中部非洲和北非，加剧类阿片危机的是曲马多；在北美则是芬太尼。这两个区域在经济、人口统计数据或一般吸毒模式方面几乎没有共同点，但都在奋力抗击由容易获得且生产成本低的物质助长的类阿片危机。	In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, it is tramadol that is exacerbating the opioid crisis; in North America it is fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economies, demographics, or general drug use patterns, yet they are struggling to fight the opioid crisis fueled by substances that are easily available and low in production costs.	yes
在北美，芬太尼等合成类阿片的使用导致了20年来类阿片过量致死人数增加。	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in the number of deaths due to opioid overdose over the past 20 years.	yes
2018年，在美国登记的67,367例过量死亡中，有三分之二涉及芬太尼。	In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the US involved fentanyl.	yes
加拿大也报告了类似的结果，只是数字较低。	Canada also reported similar results, but the numbers were lower.	no
芬太尼导致过量死亡的部分原因是非法药物市场上的芬太尼药效不可预测。	Part of the cause of fentanyl overdose deaths is the unpredictable efficacy of fentanyl on the illegal drug market.	no
在西非、中部非洲和北非，非医疗用途曲马多的市场已有大幅增长。	In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of tramadol has grown significantly.	no
在该区域，接受治疗的曲马多使用病症患者越来越多。	In this region, more and more patients with tramadol use conditions are being treated.	no
2017年，全球截获的曲马多数量显著增加，达到125吨以上的峰值。	In 2017, the majority of trout horses intercepted worldwide increased significantly, reaching a peak value of over 125 tons.	no
但2018年，在印度通过一项监管曲马多的新法律之后，全球缉获量降至32吨。	But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating tramadol, global seizures fell to 32 tons.	no
促成这两地危机的是制造简单和生产成本低，此外还有对曲马多和许多芬太尼类似物或其前体缺乏国际监管。	What contributed to the crisis in these two places was the simplicity of manufacture and low production costs, in addition to the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.	no
使这两地危机恶化的是这些物质在药品市场和非法市场上都有供应，因而更加难以发现和防止其滥用。	What worsens the crisis in both places is that these substances are available in both drug markets and illegal markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their misuse.	no
兴奋剂使用不断增多	Stimulant use continues to increase	no
兴奋剂领域以可卡因和甲基苯丙胺为主，这两种物质在其主要市场的使用量都在上升。	The stimulants sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasing in use in their main markets.	no
2018年使用可卡因的约有1,900万人，因为可卡因在北美和西欧颇为流行。	About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018 because of its popularity in North America and Western Europe.	no
同年使用苯丙胺的约有2,700万人，其中甲基苯丙胺是东南亚和北美使用最多的苯丙胺类兴奋剂。	About 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.	no
根据所掌握的多数指标，20年来这两个区域甲基苯丙胺的使用一直在扩大。	According to most of the available indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has continued to expand over the past 20 years.	no
在一些市场上，可卡因和甲基苯丙胺可以共存，有时是相互替代，这样一种药物的使用量上升时另一种药物的使用量就下降，有时是同时增加和减少以满足同一市场的需求。	In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes replacing each other. As the usage of one drug increases, the use of another drug decreases, sometimes simultaneously increasing and decreasing to meet the needs of the same market.	no
新冠肺炎使注射吸毒者的风险增高	COVID-19 increases the risk of injecting drug users	no
据估计，2018年注射吸毒的约有1,130万人，全球艾滋病毒感染约有10%是注射吸毒造成的。	According to estimates, there were about 11.3 million injecting drug users in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drug use.	no
注射吸毒者感染艾滋病毒的超过100万人，患丙型肝炎的有550万人。	More than 1 million people are infected with HIV among injecting drug users, and 5.5 million people are infected with hepatitis C.	no
2017年，因吸毒死亡的约有 58.5万人，其中一半死于丙型肝炎引起的肝病，而注射吸毒者的丙型肝炎大多仍未得到治疗。	In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug addiction. Half of them died from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, yet most of those injecting drug users still have not been treated for hepatitis C.	no
5 新冠肺炎限制措施造成的类阿片短缺可能导致使用者代之以酒精或苯二氮类药物等更容易获得的物质，或者将类阿片与合成药物混合。	5 Opioid shortages due to COVID-19 restrictions may cause users to replace more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or mix opioids with synthetic drugs.	no
随着一些使用者改用注射或更频繁地注射，可能会出现更多有害的使用方式。	As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful uses may occur.	no

欧盟峰会为难民政策争论，欧盟官员：接收过程步步瓶颈-中新网	EU summit debates refugee policy, EU officials: The acceptance process is a bottleneck step by step. -Xinhua	yes
欧盟峰会为难民政策争吵不休，欧盟官员：接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈	EU summit bickers over refugee policy. EU official: There are bottlenecks at every step of the acceptance process	yes
【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	[Niu Ruifei, Special Correspondent of the Global Times in Belgium] According to an AFP report on February 10, at the latest EU summit on the same day, European Commission President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration, making it easier to expel illegal immigrants.	yes
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	According to reports, the EU's move is a response to Europe's growing concerns about illegal immigration. Today, the EU's core problem is that the number of illegal immigrants who can eventually be deported is very small.	yes
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	According to the summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to “immediately mobilize large amounts of EU funds” to strengthen the external borders through infrastructure and surveillance.	yes
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	However, the EU and member states continue to quarrel over issues such as payment of fence fees.	yes
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	Von der Leyen has stated time and again that EU funds will not pay the relevant expenses.	yes
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	However, diplomats from some member states say that if the EU can share the part of installing cameras, observation towers, and other infrastructure along the external border, this will free up national budgets for countries and thus speed up the construction process.	yes
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	According to the European Euractiv website, EU officials acknowledge that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process. Limited acceptance capacity and the overburdened immigration authorities of member states cannot prevent refugees from submitting “countless” asylum applications in EU countries, and that the EU refugee reception system is in an almost “permanent crisis.”	yes
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	According to European Commission estimates, EU Schengen countries received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half over the previous year.	yes
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.	no
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	In this context, the summit also reached an agreement on a “principle” that EU countries can return illegal immigrants to their country based on another member state's court decision.	no
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	Furthermore, the report said that EU leaders also agreed to “increase the use of the concept of a secure country,” which will pave the way for the EU to draw up a common list.	no

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	America's escalation of the “chip war” hits the global semiconductor industry-Sinomine.com	yes
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	Recently, the US “chip war” against China has escalated — first, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate controls on exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China under pressure from the US; foreign media later reported that the US government was considering cutting off all ties between US suppliers and Huawei and prohibiting US suppliers from supplying any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order restricting US investment in the sensitive Chinese technology industry... Shortly after the start of 2023, the US continued to make bad moves to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.	yes
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	In recent years, the US has never stopped cracking down on China's “core” development. While accurately suppressing the semiconductor production supply chain to China, it is building a “de-Chinesized” semiconductor industry chain alliance in an attempt to completely “throw out” China in the advanced semiconductor industry.	yes
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it is winning over South Korea to establish a “technology alliance,” or establishing a “quadripartite alliance” for chips with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, or using mechanisms such as the “quadripartite mechanism” and “Indo-Pacific economic framework” between the US, Japan, India, and Australia, or the “Indo-Pacific Economic Framework” to establish a “small circle” in the semiconductor industry chain, the US has introduced politicized, camped, and weaponized means in an attempt to establish a closed production and supply chain cycle dominated by the US to make up for its shortcomings in the chip manufacturing field and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.	yes
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	However, America's “core tactic” against China with great fanfare is also “injuring 1,000 enemies and causing 800 self-damage.”	yes
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	Recently, Fanlin Group, a well-known American chip manufacturing equipment supplier, announced that due to the latest round of chip manufacturing equipment export bans to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.	yes
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	The global lithography giant Dutch Asmarck Holding Company recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to a rise in semiconductor prices.	yes
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	According to US media analysis, after the US government imposed an outrageous crackdown on China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies suffered greatly, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves.	yes
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	America's so-called crackdown on China's advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.	yes
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has already formed a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain.	yes
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	According to expert estimates, based on a specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products requires crossing the borders of various countries more than 70 times, reaching 100 days.	no
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, manufacturing capacity, especially advanced manufacturing technology, is weak, and it relies heavily on the East Asian region.	no
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	Even if the US makes every effort to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to a “small circle” dominated by the US, it is difficult to change the regional distribution and interdependence of semiconductor-related industries around the world.	no
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The United States has strongly “reshaped” and “de-Chinized” the semiconductor industry chain, severely impacting the global semiconductor industry.	no
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the participation of countries around the world.	no
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	In recent years, the US has taken a series of unilateral actions to successively introduce the “Innovation and Competition Act”, “2022 US Competition Act” and “Chip and Science Act” to use technological hegemony to consolidate the country's technological leadership; “win and win” on allies to induce chip manufacturers such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to set up factories in the US to try to ensure America's global leadership position in the chip field.	no
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	In the short term, the US has indeed caused trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and has reaped real benefits.	no
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	However, in the long run, the US's hysterical crackdown has forced the Chinese chip industry to make continuous breakthroughs, causing itself to lose the huge Chinese market. Ultimately, it will greatly weaken the will and ability of American technology companies to innovate, and damage the development of the global chip industry.	no

根据《国务院办公厅关于推动个人养老金发展的意见 》 ， 个人养老金资金账户资金可投资的金融产品包括银行理财、储蓄存款、商业养老保险、公募基金等。	According to the “Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Personal Pensions”, financial products that can be invested in personal pension fund account funds include bank financial management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, public funds, etc.	no
首批个人养老金理财产品发售，标志着个人养老金投资者可正式通过个人养老金资金账户购买理财产品。	The release of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marks that personal pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.	no
去年11月银保监会制定了《商业银行和理财公司个人养老金业务管理暂行办法 》 。	In November of last year, the Banking Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the “Interim Measures on the Administration of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies”.	no
《办法》规定，参加人可以通过个人养老金资金账户购买个人养老储蓄、个人养老金理财产品、个人养老金保险产品、个人养老金公募基金产品等个人养老金产品。	The “Measures” stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension products such as personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension public fund products through personal pension fund accounts.	no
随后，人社部、财政部、国家税务总局三部门发布通知，明确个人养老金制度在北京、天津，以及河北石家庄、雄安新区，山西晋城市等36个先行城市和地区启动实施。	Subsequently, the three departments of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued notices clarifying that the personal pension system will be implemented in Beijing, Tianjin, and 36 pioneering cities and regions, including Shijiazhuang and Xiong'an New District in Hebei, and Jincheng in Shanxi.	no

如今，个人养老金理财产品也聚齐之后，投资者该如何选择？	Now that personal pension wealth management products are also available, how should investors choose?	no
交银理财产品研发部专家表示，相比其他个人养老金产品，试点阶段的养老理财产品和个人养老金理财产品均具有三方面的特点。	Experts from the BOCOM Wealth Management Product Research and Development Department said that compared to other personal pension products, the pilot phase of the pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products all have three characteristics.	no
一是稳健性，风险管理机制更加健全，投资策略和理念更为稳健，并实施非母行第三方独立托管。	The first is prudence. The risk management mechanism is more complete, investment strategies and ideas are more stable, and independent hosting is implemented by a third party other than the parent bank.	no

专业人士指出，投资者要根据产品特点和自己的风险承受能力进行选择。	Experts pointed out that investors should choose according to product characteristics and their risk tolerance.	no
个人养老金储蓄具有期限较长、利率较高、安全性高的特点，适合风险承受能力弱的人群；个人养老金保险产品重在保障，比较适合无法承担投资风险，可以接受稳定收益的人群；而个人养老金理财产品和公募基金产品不保本也不保收益，有一定投资风险，但预期收益较高，适合具备一定的金融知识、风险承担能力较高的人群。	Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long terms, high interest rates, and high safety, and are suitable for people with poor risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection and are more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks and can accept stable returns; while personal pension wealth management products and public fund products do not protect capital or income, have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are high, suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk bearing ability.	no

健身行业应摆脱信任危机-中新网	The fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust-Sinomine.com	yes
又一大型健身房“暴雷”？	Another big gym “thunderstorm”?	yes
近日，知名健身机构中健健身会员维权问题引起社会关注。	Recently, the issue of rights protection for members of Zhongjian Fitness, a well-known fitness institution, attracted public attention.	yes
春节后不少会员发现自己所在门店没有正常营业，随后，关于该机构倒闭跑路的传闻引起会员恐慌，导致公安、人社部门介入。	After the Spring Festival, many members discovered that their stores were not operating normally. Afterwards, rumors about the agency going out of business caused members to panic, causing public security and social affairs departments to intervene.	yes
最后，该机构相关负责人出面回应，承诺会努力保障好员工和会员的合法权益，风波才得以平息。	Finally, the relevant person in charge of the agency came forward to respond, promising that efforts would be made to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members before the storm was brought to an end.	yes
个别健身机构的部分门店出现经营问题，暂时关闭，消费者本可心平气和等待问题解决，为何不少会员的第一反应是“大事不妙”？	Some stores of individual fitness institutions have had business problems and are temporarily closed. Consumers could have been calm and wait for the problem to be solved. Why is the first reaction of so many members “big things not good”?	yes
健身俱乐部会员维权风波背后，是行业信任危机的深层次问题。	Behind the fitness club members' rights protection storm is the deep-seated issue of the industry's trust crisis.	yes
国内传统健身房普遍采取预付费模式，“赚用户不来的钱”是其发展的底层逻辑。	Traditional gyms in China generally adopt a prepaid model, and “making money users don't get” is the underlying logic of their development.	yes
通过预售会员卡获取现金流，不断开新店，看似能够循环往复，实则寅吃卯粮，无法形成稳定的盈利模式。	Obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and continuously opening new stores seems to be able to cycle back and forth. In fact, Yin eats food and is unable to form a stable profit model.	yes
健身房跑路等行业负面信息频频传出，对消费者信心造成强烈冲击。	Negative information from gyms and other industries is frequently coming out, which has had a strong impact on consumer confidence.	yes
从市场前景看，健身房当然算得上是一门有“钱途”的好生意。	Judging from market prospects, gyms can of course be considered a good business with “money.”	no
健身赛道虽然起起伏伏，但始终受到资本关注。	Despite the ups and downs of fitness tracks, they have always received capital attention.	no
多项数据显示，文体消费等领域热度不断攀升，市场持续回暖。	According to various data, the popularity of fields such as cultural and sports consumption continues to rise, and the market continues to pick up.	no
具体到健身市场，随着居民生活水平稳步提高，健康生活理念深入人心，健身行业发展大有可为。	Specifically with regard to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the concept of a healthy lifestyle, the fitness industry has great potential for development.	no
形势越是趋好，行业越需重视发展质量。	The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.	no
然而，个别机构对消费复苏后的健身市场盲目乐观，刚从危机中走出来，又吹响开疆拓土的号角，把融资资金一股脑投入新店建设上。	However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after consumption has recovered. Having just emerged from the crisis, they are also sounding the trumpet of opening up land, investing all of their financing funds into the construction of new stores.	no
不可否认，这几年受疫情影响，不少机构退出，行业重新洗牌，有实力的企业此时选择性地加大收购力度、重新布局，未尝不是新机遇。	It is undeniable that due to the impact of the epidemic in recent years, many institutions have withdrawn, and the industry has been reshuffled. At this time, powerful enterprises have selectively stepped up their acquisition efforts and restructured. Failure to explore this is not a new opportunity.	no
但是，健身市场发展要想进入良性循环，迈上行稳致远的康庄大道，行业就必须改变传统模式，改变经营策略。	However, if the fitness market is to enter a virtuous cycle and embark on the steady and far-reaching Kangzhuang Avenue, the industry must change its traditional model and business strategy.	no
只有稳扎稳打，重新建立起消费者的信任度、安全感，才能真正赢得市场、赢得未来。	Only by working steadily and re-establishing consumers' trust and sense of security can we truly win the market and win the future.	no
相比大建新店抢占市场，健身行业当前更需要的是沉下心来优化服务，用高质量发展来稳住用户。	Compared to building a new store to seize the market, what the fitness industry currently needs more is to calm down to optimize services and use high-quality development to stabilize users.	no
首先，要靠服务留住用户。	First, it's up to the service to retain users.	no
健身房属于服务行业，其本质是坚持“用户导向”，要紧紧围绕用户需求，把经营重心放在服务提质升级上。	Gyms belong to the service industry. Their essence is to adhere to “user orientation”, focus closely on user needs, and focus operations on improving service quality and upgrading.	no
其次，要靠数字化转型提升用户体验。	Second, it is up to digital transformation to improve the user experience.	no
比如当下流行的互联网健身房模式，实现用户按次付费和场地自选。	For example, the current popular internet gym model allows users to pay per time and choose the venue.	no
同时，身体数据、运动数据得以有效利用，还可以满足社交需求，实现从线上到线下完整的服务闭环。	At the same time, physical data and exercise data can be effectively utilized to meet social needs and achieve a closed loop of complete services from online to offline.	no
没有私教推销，没有巨额年卡，用户对健身机构“跑路”的担忧降低了，信任感也就提升了。	Without private education promotions and huge annual passes, users' concerns about fitness institutions “running” have been reduced, and their sense of trust has also increased.	no
另外，还要积极探索多元业态。	Furthermore, it is also necessary to actively explore diverse business formats.	no
如今，体育消费已经从单一服务走向场景消费，健身俱乐部有望成为消费新入口，围绕健身所需的运动补给和健身器械等周边产品或将成为新的盈利点，为消费者提供更丰富选择。	Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from a single service to scenario consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become new consumers. Peripheral products such as exercise supplements and fitness equipment required for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with richer choices.	no

南京楼市再现“差价赔付”-中新网	Nanjing property market reproduces “price difference compensation” -Sinomine.com	yes
扬子晚报讯(记者 马祚波)扬子晚报/紫牛新闻记者10日在采访中发现，十余年未见的“保价协议”又重回了南京楼市，位于江北新区的一家楼盘宣称“差价赔付”，在交房前其他房源的优惠大于之前的折扣，开发商愿意为买房人换房并退还差价。	Yangzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) The Yangzi Evening News/Ziniu News reporter discovered in an interview on the 10th that the “insurance price agreement” that had not been seen in more than 10 years had returned to the Nanjing property market. A property located in the Jiangbei New Area claimed “price difference compensation.” The discount on other properties was greater than the previous discount before the house was handed over, and the developers were willing to exchange and refund the difference in price for the buyer.	yes
“保价协议”条件可不少	There are quite a few “insurance agreement” conditions	yes
这家位于江北新区的楼盘名为保利扬子萃云台，看房人孙先生告诉记者，他在上周末逛楼盘时发现了一则“声明”。	The name of this property in the Jiangbei New Area is Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai. The housekeeper, Mr. Sun, told the reporter that he discovered a “statement” while visiting the property last weekend.	yes
他发给记者的图片上显示，该楼盘的开发商承诺，凡是在2月1日-2月28日期间购买房源的，自双方签订买卖合同之日起至对应房源交付，若该项目其他房源的优惠折扣大于之前购房所享折扣的(限与该商品房属于同一户型、同一楼栋、同一单元、同一物业类型的其他未售商品房)，开发商可以为购房者换房并退还差价。	The picture he sent to the reporter showed that the developer of the property promised that anyone who purchased the property between February 1 and February 28 from the date the two parties signed the purchase and sale contract until the delivery of the corresponding property, if the preferential discount for other properties in the project is greater than the discount previously enjoyed by the purchase of the house (limited to other unsold commercial properties of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type as the commercial property), the developer can exchange the house for the buyer and refund the difference in price.	yes
孙先生表示，置业顾问表示这其实就是一份“保价协议”，目的是让买家放心出手，不用担心开发企业降价促销，“现在就怕买完了它就降价了，去售楼处闹吧没时间，不闹的话也确实窝心”。	Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually an “insured price agreement”. The purpose is to reassure the buyer and not worry about the development company's price reduction promotion. “Now I'm afraid that the price will drop once I've bought it. There's no time to go to the sales office; if you don't make a fuss, I'm really worried.”	yes
还有不少买房人则认为，“保价协议”虽然是在给购房者吃“定心丸”，不过条件却不低。	There are also quite a few buyers who think that although the “insurance price agreement” is a “reassurance pill” for buyers, the conditions are not low.	yes
打算在江北买一套刚需房的郑女士说，保价的房源首先是要同一户型，还得在同一楼栋、同一个单元，买家可以比价的房源寥寥，因此“门槛”还是蛮高的。	Ms. Zheng, who is planning to buy a house she just needed in Jiangbei, said that the first thing to insured property is to have the same apartment type; it also has to be in the same building and unit. There are few properties that buyers can compare prices, so the “threshold” is still quite high.	yes
也有购房者认为，由于信息不对称，销售时不排除给出额外的让利，买家“维权”的难度不小。	There are also buyers who think that due to asymmetric information and additional concessions are not ruled out when selling, it is not too difficult for buyers to “defend their rights.”	yes
能否留住买房人有待观察	Whether it can keep buyers remains to be seen	no
记者在南京网上房地产上查询得知，该楼盘于去年11月首领两幢楼共计252套房源的销许，户型面积有105平方米、114平方米、129平方米等，全装修销许均价为39843元/㎡。	The reporter inquired online real estate in Nanjing and learned that in November of last year, the property led the sale of a total of 252 units in the two buildings. The apartment area was 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., and the average price of the fully furnished license was 39,843 yuan/㎡.	no
不过两个多月过去，网上房地产显示目前该楼盘的未售总套数为157套，占比为62.3%，其中8号楼共计128套，未售套数达113套，7号楼的124套中也有44套未售，项目的总成交套数只有33套，占比仅为13%。	However, more than two months have passed, and online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in this property is currently 157, accounting for 62.3%. Of these, Building 8 has a total of 128 units, and the number of unsold units has reached 113. Of the 124 units in Building 7, 44 units are also unsold. The total number of units sold for the project is only 33, accounting for only 13%.	no
市场人士介绍，“保价协议”在2008年也曾在南京出现过。	According to market sources, “insurance price agreements” also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.	no
当年8月份，河西黄山路上的楼盘横塘西苑为了吸引买房人眼球，推出了《保价计划》，具体内容为“公司郑重承诺，若一年内项目优惠幅度扩大，由此产生的差额，公司将按差额退还给老业主”。	In August of that year, in order to attract the attention of buyers, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched the “Price Insurance Plan”. The details were “The company solemnly promises that if the project discount margin expands within one year, the difference resulting from this will be refunded to the old owners.”	no
此后2011年4月，南京也有9家楼盘拿出部分房源承诺“差价赔付”。	Since then, in 2011/4, 9 properties in Nanjing also offered part of their listings and promised to “pay the difference in price.”	no
“楼市在回暖，此时更需要一针‘强心剂’。	“The property market is picking up, and a 'strength agent' is needed even more at this time.	no
”南京地产行业一位资深操盘手沈先生表示，“保价协议”也是房企的营销方式之一。	Mr. Shen, a senior trader in the Nanjing real estate industry, said that “insured price agreements” are also one of the marketing methods for housing enterprises.	no
他认为如今开发企业比买房人更需要信心，推出“保价协议”其实也是在给其打气。	He believes that development companies now need more confidence than buyers; the introduction of an “insured price agreement” is actually encouraging them.	no
至于能否留住买房人，他表示这取决于调控政策、贷款门槛等多重因素的影响，就目前来看仍有待观察。	As to whether buyers can be retained, he said that this depends on the influence of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, so it remains to be seen.	no

统计显示，1月台湾地区进出口双降，出超金额仅23.4亿美元，创近3年来最低水平。	Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports both fell in January, and the excess amount was only 2.34 billion US dollars, the lowest level in the past 3 years.	yes
台当局财政事务主管部门认为，全球终端需求减少，产业调整库存抑制厂商购料意愿，出口颓势短期难见改善，台湾今年首季出口衰退恐高于预期。	The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that global demand for terminals has declined, industrial adjustments have curbed manufacturers' willingness to buy materials, that the decline in exports is unlikely to improve in the short term, and that Taiwan's export decline in the first quarter of this year is likely to be higher than expected.	no
据台湾中华经济研究院发布，今年1月台湾制造业采购经理人指数(PMI)经季节调整后为40.4%，较去年12月续跌3.3个百分点，连续7个月紧缩。	According to the release of Taiwan's Chinese Economic Research Institute, Taiwan's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for January this year was 40.4% after seasonal adjustment, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and contracted for 7 consecutive months.	no

台“中央大学”经济系教授吴大任分析，出口衰退可能造成出口制造业厂商现金流出现问题，债务违约风险上升。	Wu Daren, professor of economics at Taiwan's “Chung-Ang University”, analyzed that the decline in exports may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies, and the risk of debt default increases.	no
同时，订单减少导致厂商削减人力成本，影响劳动市场和家庭经济，反过来冲击消费能力。	At the same time, fewer orders have caused manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn impacted consumption capacity.	no
台湾经济研究院研究员邱达生认为，今年欧美通胀状况未解，需求持续萎缩，预估台湾出口衰退会延续到上半年。	Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the US is unresolved this year, demand continues to shrink, and it is estimated that Taiwan's export decline will continue until the first half of the year.	no

报告认为，电商行业内容生态是一个综合性概念，是将电商与内容进行整合，但并非所有内容都可与电商整合，好的PGC(专业生产内容)与UGC(用户原创内容)才是与电商进行整合的优质载体，内容平台价值越高，消费与推广的场景也就越来越丰富，电商植入的可能性也就越高，商业价值也就越强，这种公共领域和私人领域逐步集成分布的电商内容生产和内容消费的比例也就会越高。	According to the report, the e-commerce industry's content ecosystem is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce with content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (professional production content) and UGC (user original content) are high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce.

High-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the “hard currency” of the e-commerce industry.	no
同时，内容成为电商发展新阶段的根本和抓手，知识付费、专业性知识、KOL(关键意见领袖)等PGC内容开始在电商直播中成为标配。	At the same time, content has become the foundation and starting point of the new stage of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payments, professional knowledge, and KOLs (key opinion leaders) are beginning to become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.	no
展望电商行业的未来发展，喻国明提出两方面的建议。	Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.	no
一个是从内容结构提升的角度看，推动电商内容生态健康程度和质量整体提升，打造正向内容创作和管理标准，实现电商行业内容生态健康系统指数与动态均衡。	One is to promote the overall improvement of the ecological health and quality of e-commerce content from the perspective of improving the content structure, establish positive content creation and management standards, and achieve a balance between the e-commerce industry's content ecological health system index and dynamics.	no
另一个是从外部生态看，要实现内容电商行业的健康发展和外部环境的价值协同与共创。	The other is that from the perspective of the external ecology, it is necessary to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and value collaboration and co-creation of the external environment.	no
“未来电商行业还需要更多的数据、人工智能方面的支持，形成对未来发展稳定性的预测；此外，为商家提供更规范、健康的成长空间，实现电商行业中企业、用户、产品与服务的价值协同，共创健康内容生态。	“The future e-commerce industry also needs more data and artificial intelligence support to predict future development stability; in addition, it provides merchants with a more standardized and healthy growth space, realizes value synergy between enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and co-creates a healthy content ecosystem.	no

Kim Ju-ae snuggled up to her father, looked at her father warmly and whispered several times. She patted her father's cheek with her hands and even touched her father's chest. The interactive footage of the father and daughter was broadcast all over the country.	yes
然而，第一夫人李雪主只能退到一旁。	However, the first lady Li Xuezhu was only able to back off.	yes
综合韩国“朝鲜新闻”等报导，金正恩、李雪主夫妇7日带著女儿金主爱出席晚宴的官方合照中，金主爱不仅罕见坐在父母正中间C位，在隔日晚间建军节第75周年阅兵仪式上，她还与金正恩一起登上主席台。	According to reports from South Korea's “North Korea News” and other reports, in the official group photo of Kim Jong-un and Lee Seok-joo attending the dinner on the 7th with their daughter Kim Joo Ae, Kim Joo Ae not only rarely sits in C position in the middle of her parents; at the military parade on the 75th anniversary of Army Day the next night, she also appeared on the podium with Kim Jong-un.	yes
朝鲜官媒“朝鲜中央电视台”事后释出阅兵式影片，曝光了更多父女情深的画面。	The North Korean official media “North Korea Central Television” later released a military parade video, which revealed more images of the father and daughter being affectionate.	yes
金正恩在主席台上数次与女儿对望，两人脸上的笑容从未退去，还互相在耳边讲悄悄话，金主爱一度以双手捧起老爸的两颊，金正恩也以灿笑回应。	Kim Jong-un confronted her daughter several times on the podium. The smiles on their faces never went back. They also kept quiet messages in each other's ears. At one point, Kim Joo-ae picked up her dad's cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un also responded with a big smile.	yes
其他官媒画面也显示，金主爱与金正恩坐在室内沙发椅上时，用手不断摸著父亲的脸；她与父亲挽著手走路时，一边用手摸在金正恩的胸口。	Other official media footage also showed that when Kim Joo Ae and Kim Jong-un were sitting on an indoor sofa chair, they constantly touched her father's face with her hands; while she walked hand in hand with her father, she touched Kim Jong-un's chest with her hands.	yes
而第一夫人李雪主全程只能走在后头或是坐在一旁，总是距离丈夫和女儿有几步之差。	However, the first lady, Li Xuezhu, can only walk or sit on the side the whole time; she is always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.	yes
韩国媒体指出，金主爱自去年11月18日试射火星17飞弹首次在公开露脸以来，3个月以来曝光机率越来越高，至今已是第5度出现于正式场合。	South Korean media pointed out that since Kim Joo Ae first made a public appearance on November 18 last year to test the Mars 17 missile, the exposure rate has been getting higher and higher over the past 3 months, and it is now the 5th time she has appeared on the official scene.	yes
朝鲜官媒提及金主爱时使用了最亲爱的子弟、尊贵的子弟等极高尊称，也播出金主爱在看台上俯瞰阅兵行进时反覆高喊誓死拥护白头血统的片段。	North Korea's official media mentioned that Kim Joo Ae used the dearest child and honorable child of Kim Joo Ae in the stands, and also broadcast a clip of Kim Joo Ai repeatedly shouting and swearing to death to support the Baekdu lineage while watching the military parade in the stands.	no
这些迹象让外界怀疑金主爱是否已经被内定为金氏政权的继承人，《华盛顿邮报》分析认为“这是金正恩把中学年纪的女儿推上接班人地位的讯号”，不过也有观点认为，这样的判断仍为时过早，在金正恩膝下有儿子的情况中，仍保有各种可能性。	These signs have made outsiders doubt whether Kim Joo-ae has been internally designated as the heir to the Kim administration. The “Washington Post” analyzed that “this is a sign that Kim Jong-un has promoted her middle school daughter to the position of successor,” but there are also opinions that it is still too early to make such a judgment. In a situation where Kim Jong-un has a son under her, all possibilities are still open.	no
重阳问答︱如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Chongyang Q&A | How do you view the US non-farm payrolls data for January exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Watch － A professional financial news website	yes
Q：请问重阳投资，如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势？	Q: May I ask Chongyang Investment, what do you think of the US non-farm payrolls data for January exceeding expectations and future trends?	yes
A：2月3日美国劳工部公布2023年1月非农就业数据，新增非农就业51.7万人，大幅高于市场预期的18.9万人；失业率降至3.4%，为近50年以来的最低位；时薪同比增速4.4%，环比增速0.3%，略有放缓。	A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor released non-farm payrolls data for January 2023, adding 517,000 new non-farm payrolls, significantly higher than market expectations of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years; hourly wages grew 4.4% year on year and 0.3% month on month, a slight slowdown.	yes
从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	In terms of total volume, there are many one-time and technical disturbances in this data, such as faculty and staff on strike and returning to work, revisions to survey statistics, and updates to seasonal factors. There may be future revisions (see the addition of 504,000 non-farmers in January 2022, downgraded from 504,000 to 364,000 people). Non-farm payrolls may not be as strong as reflected in the data.	yes
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the share is relatively low; new jobs in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care have rebounded sharply, and data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.	yes
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Combined with the service sector PMI that far exceeded expectations, the recovery in job vacancies and labor gap data, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service sector ushered in a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.	yes
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	We believe that it is difficult to improve tight supply and demand in the US job market without going through a recession.	yes
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	Currently, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly. In particular, the labor participation rate of 25-54 year olds is already close to the high before the epidemic.	yes
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	In addition to this, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of austerity policies on the job market due to excess savings of American residents and strong consumer credit.	yes
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	Continued tight supply and demand in the US job market will be the undertone of the US economy in 2023.	yes
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	The superposition is now nearing the end of interest rate hikes, and inflation expectations are repeated over and over again. We are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.	no
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Prior to the release of this data, the expectations of the US stock and bond foreign exchange market on the Fed's interest rate hike path were too optimistic.	no
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	As inflation data continues to improve, while shortening the pace of interest rate hikes, the Fed continues to maintain the weak balance of market inflation expectations. However, the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statement. It not only expects an early cessation of interest rate hikes, but also expects two interest rate cuts at the end of the year.	no
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	In a situation where supply and demand in the labor market are tight and the impact of austerity policies is unclear, we believe that the Fed's guidance on raising interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and that adjustments to extreme market expectations and the congestion of transactions may cause some damage to the market.	no
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	Despite this, the stubbornness of the wage growth rate is difficult to reverse the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the year-on-year negative M2 data and the gradual improvement of leading indicators in various CPI segments, the US CPI data has moved to a stage of rapid decline since October. The stubbornness of the wage growth rate will only underpin future inflation data. Current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of the game after the next inflation data is released.	no
杉杉创始人郑永刚因突发心脏疾病过世 曾带领中国服装第一股转型 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan, passed away due to a sudden heart disease and led the transformation of the first line of clothing in China - Economic Watch － A professional financial news website	yes
经济观察网 记者 郑淯心 2月11日，认证主体为杉杉控股有限公司（以下简称“杉杉控股 ” ） 的微信公众号发布讣告，杉杉企业创始人、杉杉控股董事局主席郑永刚因突发心脏疾病救治无效，于2023年2月10日去世，享年65岁。	On February 11, Zheng Jixin, a reporter from the Economic Watch Network, published an obituary on the WeChat account of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Shanshan Holdings”). Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan Enterprise and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to ineffective treatment for a sudden heart disease.	yes
上世纪80年代，郑永刚担任国营棉纺厂的厂长，随着调任，1989年郑永刚成为杉杉股份的前身宁波云港服装总厂的厂长。	In the 80s of the last century, Zheng Yonggang was the factory manager of a state-owned cotton spinning factory. Following his transfer, Zheng Yonggang became the factory manager of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd. in 1989.	yes
2022年12月，在第二十届中国企业领袖年会暨第二十二届中国企业未来之星年会上，郑永刚在演讲中称，在上世纪90年代的中国西服市场，杉杉品牌的市占率曾高达37 % 。	In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Conference of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd Annual Conference of Chinese Business Future Stars, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 90s of the last century, the market share of the Shanshan brand was as high as 37 percent.	yes
1996年杉杉股份（600884.SH）上市，成为中国服装业第一家上市公司。	In 1996, Shanshan Co., Ltd. (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in the Chinese garment industry.	yes
就在服装业务如日中天时，杉杉集团却开始转型，因为郑永刚意识到 ， “ 一旦市场放开，中国品牌自然会形成一个梯队式品牌市场，杉杉西服想一直独领风骚，长期成为国人的国服的可能性不大 ” 。	Just when the clothing business was in full swing, the Shanshan Group began to transform because Zheng Yonggang realized, “Once the market is liberalized, Chinese brands will naturally form an echelon brand market. Shanshan Western clothing has always dominated the style, and it is unlikely that it will become the national uniform of the Chinese people for a long time.”	yes
1999年，杉杉开始研究企业转型，郑永刚回忆当年 ， “ 我们来到上海，寻求到底转型做什么，专门找了很多专家学者，连续不断地开一些诸葛亮会、务虚研讨会。	In 1999, Shan Shan began studying enterprise transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, “We came to Shanghai to find out exactly what to do with the transformation. We specifically sought out many experts and scholars, and held continuous meetings and seminars.	yes
最后，我们设定了两个大的战略方向。	Finally, we set two major strategic directions.	yes
第一个方向是新能源新材料，另外一个是大健康有未来 ” 。	The first direction is new energy and new materials; the other is that big health has a future”.	yes
战略方向确定后，杉杉开始寻找合作，那时候鞍山热能院为鞍钢配套的炭素研究所在做国家863课题，科研经费不够，于是杉杉和鞍山热能院碳素研究所签署合作协议，共同推动国家863课题“中间相炭微球”项目产业化，从事负极材料的研发、生产和销售，在国内实现负极材料的商用推广。	After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to seek cooperation. At that time, the Carbon Research Institute supporting Angang Steel of the Anshan Thermal Energy Institute was working on the national 863 project, and research funding was insufficient, so Shan Shan signed a cooperation agreement with the Anshan Thermal Energy Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 “intermediate phase carbon microsphere” project, engage in R&D, production and sales of anode materials, and achieve commercial promotion of anode materials domestically.	yes
2001年，杉杉股份实现中间相炭微球的规模化生产，开始国产化替代，取代日本成为国内中间相炭微球主要供应商。	In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. achieved large-scale production of intermediate-phase carbon microspheres and began localized replacement, replacing Japan as the main domestic supplier of intermediate-phase carbon microspheres.	no
这是中国第一家锂离子电池负极材料生产企业，实现了锂离子电池负极材料国产化。	This is the first lithium ion battery anode material manufacturer in China, and has achieved localization of lithium ion battery anode materials.	no
随着锂电池的应用迅速普及，杉杉股份的锂电池业务开始逐步发展，2007年锂电材料业务被写入了杉杉股份的主营业务，服装业务营收占比逐年减少，直至2013年，杉杉股份的锂电材料业务收入全面超过服装业务。	With the rapid spread of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Shanshan Co., Ltd. began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium battery materials business was included as the main business of Shanshan Co., Ltd., and the revenue share of the clothing business declined year by year. Until 2013, Shanshan Co., Ltd.'s lithium battery materials business revenue completely surpassed the clothing business.	no
2021年2月，杉杉股份成功并购LG化学偏光片业务，进军LCD偏光片市场，并成立偏光片企业杉金光电，该领域技术含量比较高，杉杉的主要的竞争对手都是世界500强，如韩国三星、日本的住友化学、日东电工。	In February 2021, Sugisan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chemical's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer company Sugikin Optoelectronics. The technical content in this field is relatively high. Sugisan's main competitors are the world's top 500 competitors, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko.	no
郑永刚曾分享过投后管理的心得 ， “ 中国的民营企业收购国际上的一些高科技企业，成功概率比较低，为什么那些收购会失败？	Zheng Yonggang once shared his post-investment management experience, “Chinese private enterprises acquire some international high-tech enterprises, and the probability of success is relatively low. Why did those acquisitions fail?	no
因为大家都会去考虑，我花了那么多钱，我得去派人管对吧，这是通常会做的一个行为 ” ， 然而郑永刚则不同，杉杉收购成功的那一天，郑永刚就到杉金光电当众宣布，杉杉作为杉金的大股东，决定实施一企两制，除了郑永刚担任董事长，杉杉企业的人不派到杉金，采取授权经营的方式，原有的分配制度、企业文化、各项管理等模式不变。	Because everyone thinks about it, I've spent so much money, so I have to send someone to manage it.” But Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day Shanshan's acquisition was successful, Zheng Yonggang went to Shanjin Optoelectronics to publicly announce that Shanshan, as Shanjin's majority shareholder, decided to implement one enterprise, two systems. Except for Zheng Yonggang as the chairman, the people of Shanshan Enterprise did not send Shanjin. The original distribution system, corporate culture, and various management models remained unchanged.	no
ICC鑫椤资讯发布2022年负极数据显示，杉杉负极2022年出货量突破20万吨，同比增幅100 % ， 市场份额达16 % ， 人造石墨负极材料出货量蝉联榜首。	According to the 2022 negative electrode data released by ICC Xinyi Information, Shanshan anode's shipments in 2022 exceeded 200,000 tons, an increase of 100 percent over the previous year, a market share of 16 percent, and the shipment volume of artificial graphite anode materials topped the list.	no
在偏光片业务方面，Yano Research统计显示，公司旗下杉金光电2022年全球市场份额达到29 % ， 预计2023年市场份额将达到32 % ， 持续位列全球第一。	In terms of the polarizer business, Yano Research statistics show that Sugikin Optoelectronics, a subsidiary of the company, has a global market share of 29% in 2022, and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.	no

On February 10, the stock price of Shanshan Co., Ltd. was 19.24 yuan/share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.	no
2月9日，杉杉股份在互动平台表示，2022年底，公司石墨化有效产能约10万吨，眉山项目的石墨化产能尚在爬坡中。	On February 9, Shanshan Co., Ltd. said on an interactive platform that at the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite production capacity was about 100,000 tons, and the graphite production capacity of the Meishan project was still climbing.	no

He has served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Material Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and the deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co., Ltd.	no

各份额登记机构账户体系相互独立，缺乏行业统一的查询渠道。	The account systems of each share registration agency are independent of each other, and there is no unified search channel for the industry.	yes
有行业人士表示，2021年末我国基金投资者超过7.2亿人，也就是说，全国有一半人都投资了基金产品。	Some people in the industry said that at the end of 2021, there were more than 720 million fund investors in China. In other words, half of the people in the country invested in fund products.	yes
此前，投资者需要通过不同销售机构查询购买情况，而通过“基金E账户”可以查询所有销售渠道购买的情况，持有基金情况一目了然。	Previously, investors needed to check the purchase situation through different sales agencies, but they could check the purchase situation through all sales channels through the “Fund E Account”, so the status of fund holdings was clear at a glance.	yes
“基金E账户”APP是什么？	What is the “Fund E Account” app?	no

上海证券基金评价研究中心业务负责人刘亦千向经济观察网记者表示，投资者可以通过“基金E账户”App一站式获知其所有的场外公募基金持有情况，帮助其找回“被遗忘的资产”，更重要的是为客户实现了综合基金投资情况的全账户信息归集，帮助客户更及时、准确、完整的掌握自身投资情况，从而更好地优化自身的基金组合配置，更好地规划自身的财务安排。	Liu Yiqian, head of business at the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told the reporter of the Economic Watch Network that investors can use the “Fund E Account” app to know all of their OTC public fund holdings in one stop to help them recover “forgotten assets”. More importantly, it has collected full account information on the investment status of comprehensive funds for customers, helping customers to better grasp their investment situation in a timely, accurate and complete manner, so as to better optimize their own fund portfolio allocations and better plan their own financial arrangements.	no
如何注册使用？	How do I sign up for use?	no
记者注意到，目前，“基金E账户”APP已在华为、苹果、小米、OPPO、vivo等手机应用商店上架，但APP尚处于公开试运行阶段，注册需要填写邀请码，投资者可以联系所持有基金的基金管理人获取。	The reporter noticed that currently, the “Fund E Account” app has been launched on mobile app stores such as Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, and vivo, but the app is still in the public trial stage. Registration requires filling in an invitation code. Investors can obtain it by contacting the fund manager of the fund they hold.	no
上海一家中大型公募基金客服人员向经济观察网记者提供了一个6位数的邀请码，并告诉记者，“APP试运行阶段，中国结算提供给每个基金管理人一定数量的邀请码，投资者电话过来获取，我们都会提供。	The customer service staff of a medium to large public fund in Shanghai provided a 6-digit invitation code to the reporter of the Economic Watch Network and told the reporter, “During the trial operation of the app, China Settlement provided each fund manager with a certain number of invitation codes. Investors called to obtain them, and we would all provide them.	no
等试运行结束后，开放用户注册时就不用邀请码了。	Once the trial run is over, there is no need for an invitation code to open user registration.	no
”	”	no
记者根据证监会官网公示的“基金E账户”下载及使用说明相关文件进行了账户注册并完成查询，整个过程耗时仅几分钟，主要分为四步：用户注册、实名认证、基金账户绑定、公募基金查询。	The reporter registered the account and completed the inquiry according to the relevant documents of the “Fund E Account” download and usage instructions published on the official website of the Securities Regulatory Commission. The entire process only took a few minutes. It was mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiries.	no
通过实名认证这一步之后，点击“资产”基金绑定按钮，记者通过各个基金销售平台购买的所有基金产品都呈现在绑定选项列表中（可绑定账户），完成绑定后就可以直观看到所投基金总资产并可以开始使用查询功能了。	After passing the real-name authentication step, click the “Asset” fund binding button. All fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms are displayed in the binding options list (can be bound to accounts). After completing the binding, you can visually see the total assets of the invested funds and start using the search function.	no
值得注意的是，“基金E账户”仅为投资者提供查询服务，并不能进行申赎买卖。	It is worth noting that the “Fund E Account” only provides inquiry services for investors, and cannot conduct redemption transactions.	no
“基金 E 账户”所显示的数据日期一般为用户进行查询的日期（T日)往前推三个交易日。	The data date displayed on the “Fund E Account” is generally pushed forward three trading days from the date the user made an inquiry (T-day).	no
比如，在2 月10日打开“基金E账户”，资产页所显示的总资产、基金份额、基金净值对应日期为该日期往前推三个交易日，即2月7日。	For example, if you open a “Fund E Account” on February 10, the dates corresponding to total assets, fund shares, and fund net worth displayed on the asset page are pushed forward three trading days from that date, that is, February 7.	no

阿拉斯加上空被击落的 “物体”究竟是什么？	What exactly is the “object” that was shot down over Alaska?	yes

五角大楼说，第二个被击落的物体于周四晚上首次进入美国领空，在阿拉斯加东北部上空移动时被美国军方跟踪，飞行高度为1.2万米（4万英尺），其大小与一辆小型汽车差不多，与先前被击落的那个中国间谍气球相比要小很多。	The Pentagon said the second object that was shot down first entered US airspace on Thursday night and was tracked by the US military as it moved over northeastern Alaska. It flew at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet). It was about the size of a small car, much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that had been shot down previously.	yes
五角大楼还认为，目前没有迹象显示，这个物体是可操纵的。	The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no indication that this object can be manipulated.	yes
白宫国家安全委员会战略沟通协调员约翰·科比周五表示，虽然这个在高空飞行的物体的具体样子尚不清楚，但它“对民航飞机的安全构成了合理的威胁”。	White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator John Bryant said on Friday that although the exact appearance of this high-altitude object is unclear, it “poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aviation aircraft.”	yes
科比表示，这个物体与美国境内发现的那个间谍气球不同，它上面没有悬挂“有效载荷”。	Bryant said that unlike the spy balloon discovered in the US, there was no “payload” suspended on it.	yes

目前网上许多的分析和猜测认为，这可能又是一只中国气球。	Currently, many online analyses and speculations suggest that this may be another Chinese balloon.	no
它可能与入侵美国领空的那只间谍气球和在拉美上空飘动的那只中国气球一样都来自中国，它们在不同地点执行某种任务。	It probably came from China just like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America; they carried out some kind of mission at different locations.	no
也有人把阿拉斯加的这个“物体”与“不明飞行物”（UFO）联系在一起。	There are also people who have linked this “object” in Alaska to a “UFO” (UFO).	no
美国新闻周刊的报道引用美国前众议员彼得·梅杰（Peter Meijer）周五在推特上发出的推文说，“真希望这个‘不明飞行物’也是一个间谍气球，而不是一个合法的UFO”。	The US Newsweek report quoted former US Congressman Peter Meijer (Peter Meijer) on Twitter on Friday as saying, “I really hope this' UFO 'is also a spy balloon, not a legal UFO.”	no
“将外星飞船与气象气球混为一谈的讽刺意味很令人惊讶，但这不值得引发一场星际冲突，”梅杰说。	“The irony of mixing an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth triggering an interstellar clash,” Major said.	no
梅杰是在科比证实阿拉斯加的这个物体被击落之后不久发出这个推文的。	Major tweeted this shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.	no
新闻周刊说，怀疑这个物体是UFO的不止是梅杰一人。	Newsweek said that it was not only Major who suspected that the object was a UFO.	no

接着客服通知要么保留货品补偿一定金额，要么退货。	The customer service then told them to either keep the item in compensation for a certain amount or return the item.	yes
这就是亚马逊的处理方式？	Is this how Amazon handles it?	yes
真的很难以置信，本身衣物发错并不是我的问题，作为一个消费者我要求获得我应获得的商品，并没有提出什么很夸张的要求，亚马逊却改名字，说无库存。	It's really unbelievable. The wrong clothing itself wasn't my problem. As a consumer, I asked for the products I should get, and I didn't make any exaggerated claims, but Amazon changed the name and said it was out of stock.	yes
这是我的第一个长评，希望这不是我的最后一个。	This is my first long review and hopefully it won't be my last.	yes
让人无法理解的袖子	Incomprehensible sleeves	yes
说是牛皮的，也确实比较硬，但仔细看的话，局部有很多细小的裂痕，搞不清楚是否是真皮的，另外这个衣服的袖子真是让人无法理解，通常夹克的袖子要比衣摆长一些，不过通常也就1-2厘米，这件衣服足足长了5厘米，手臂自然下垂应该在手掌虎口的位置，但这件衣服的袖子都盖过手指了。	Speaking of cowhide, it's really hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks in the area, so it's hard to tell if it's genuine. Also, the sleeves of this dress are really incomprehensible. Normally, the sleeves of a jacket are a bit longer than the hem, but usually it's only 1-2 cm. This dress is 5 cm long, so the arms should naturally hang down at the base of the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this dress all cover the fingers.	yes
买衣服容易，退货也容易。	Buying clothes is easy, and so is returning them.	yes
但是要退还钱真不知何时？	But I really don't know when to get my money back?	yes
衣服做工不错，因为版型偏小，只得退货，但是退了货以后，至今一个多星期过去了，还没有收到退款？	The garment was made very well, I had to return it because the fit was too small, but it's been over a week since I returned it, and I haven't received a refund yet?	yes
而且要购买者自已和那个诚信度不怎么样的全峰快递联系，这是自购亚马逊的物品以来最糟糕的一次购物！	Also, the buyer must contact Quanfeng Express, which is not very honest. This is the worst shopping since buying an Amazon item!	yes
但店家还是不错的，积极配合催促快递及时退款，但是这个全峰快递实在的工作是做的相当让人愤怒，拖拉半个月左右才退款，这种合作伙伴是要拖亚马逊的后腿的，工作效率差，没有服务意识！	However, the store is pretty good. They are actively cooperating with the courier to urge the courier to refund the money in a timely manner, but the actual work of Quanfeng Express is quite infuriating. It delays the refund for about half a month. This kind of partner wants to drag Amazon back. The work efficiency is poor, and there is no sense of service!	yes
更适合年轻人	More suitable for young people	yes
99秒杀的。	Killed in 99 seconds.	yes
毛裤的做工、颜色、手感都不错，柔软/薄厚适中，没有煤油味儿。	The sweater has good workmanship, color, and feel, soft/thin, and has no kerosene smell.	yes

似乎腰间没有松紧带，想加松点腰围还挺困难。	There doesn't seem to be an elastic band around the waist, so it's quite difficult to loosen the waistline.	yes
另外，贴身穿是不舒服的。	Also, it's not comfortable to wear close.	yes
很好 颜色不是很鲜艳	Very good, the color is not very bright	yes
刚买就涨了两百多，这是什么情况。	Just bought it and it went up more than 200. What kind of situation is this.	yes
第一次亚马逊用的合作的天天烂快递，第一次送货没在家，后来主动和快递员约了两次送货时间，那个快递员都不送，后来直接给我退货了，这个该死的快递员一点诚信也没有，强烈建议不要再用那个天天烂快递了。	The first time I used Amazon's partner Tiantian Express, it wasn't at home for the first time. Later, I took the initiative to schedule two delivery times with the courier. The courier didn't deliver it, but later returned it directly to me. This damn courier didn't have any integrity, and I strongly recommend not to use the Tiantian Express anymore.	yes
这一次还有一件体恤衫也给我退货了，再拍也涨价了一百多元。	Another t-shirt was also returned to me this time, and the price went up by more than 100 yuan even after shooting again.	yes
亚马逊自营不应该出现这样商品	Amazon is self-operated and this kind of product should not appear	yes
产品特价的时候购买，价格不低，看评论也是很不错的产品。	I bought it when the product was on sale. The price is not low, and it's also a great product to read reviews.	yes
实际收到产品的时候让我目瞪口呆，商品表面大面积磨损，多处其他地方都有磨损，不是次品就是旧品，稍后上图。	I was dumbfounded when I actually received the product. The surface of the product had extensive wear and tear, and there were many other areas of wear and tear. It was either defective or used, as pictured later.	yes
我申请退货，厂家的人看到图片后说是运输导致，这不是瞎说吗？	I requested a return. After seeing the picture, the manufacturer said it was due to shipping. Isn't that nonsense?	yes
商品内部怎么可能磨损？	How can the inside of the product wear out?	yes
只有两种可能，要么次品旧品，要么就是我故意损坏商品，然后拿去退货。	There are only two possibilities: either the defective product is used, or I intentionally damaged the item and then took it back and returned it.	yes
客观来讲，我没有证据证明我没有损坏商品，但是以我在亚马逊购物的信用记录来讲，我认为这样的商品不应该出现在亚马逊自营商品中，客户选择亚马逊自营就是信任，customer win，we win，客户的胜利就是厂商的胜利，希望大家一起努力改进，谢谢。	Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I didn't damage the product, but in terms of my Amazon shopping credit history, I don't think this kind of product should appear in Amazon's own products. Customers choose Amazon's own management is trust. Customer win, we win. The customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory. I hope everyone works together to improve it, thank you.	yes
我使用该产品不到一年，就出现两个E2，我不知道如何处理?	I've been using this product for less than a year and have had two E2s, I don't know what to do with them?	yes
我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?	I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but red E2 often appeared on the right side of the receiver in March 2016. There must be a problem with the transmitter module. This is probably not in line with the transmitter module described on the Amazon website. I can't find any after-sales service on the Amazon website. Now I don't know what to do?	yes
还行吧	Is it OK	yes
第一次购买是坏的。	The first purchase was bad.	yes
感觉不像新的。	It doesn't feel like new.	yes
盒子上的标签被撕了，机身上标签也破了。	The label on the box was torn off, and the label on the fuselage was also broken.	yes
而且老是白屏。	And it's always a white screen.	yes
换了以后好了。	It will be fine after the replacement.	yes
换货挺迅速，晚上有点模糊，视角不是很广，但是普通家用够了。	The replacement was very quick. It's a bit blurry at night. The field of view isn't very broad, but it's enough for normal household use.	yes
不足就是没有卡，自己买的，还有就是以前在亚马逊买过手机。	The downside is that I don't have a card; I bought one myself, and I've bought a cell phone on Amazon before.	yes
包装上会有贴纸，防止包装被打开，这次没有，买手机时候还有个贴纸一样的章，可以贴在保修卡上，这次没有。	There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened. Not this time. When I bought the phone, there was also a sticker like a sticker, which can be attached to the warranty card, but not this time.	yes
不知道是不是东西便宜了就没有，很困惑。	I don't know if the stuff is cheap, so I'm very confused.	yes
等待供货商回复	Waiting for a response from the supplier	yes
包装没有任何标识，直接给供货商致电说，回答没标识是正品，如怀疑可用边角料邮寄到强生公司验货，还留下车牌号以及电话号码，承诺会发短信通知把我的信息输入强生官网保修卡，到现在也没收到短信啊？	There was no logo on the package. I called the supplier directly and said that the answer was that the product was genuine. If I suspected that I could use scraps to mail it to Johnson & Johnson for inspection, and also left my license plate number and phone number, promising that I would send a text message to enter my information into the Johnson & Johnson warranty card. Haven't I received a text message until now?	yes
上午收到机油，下午就换上了。	The engine oil was received in the morning and replaced in the afternoon.	yes
第二次购买。	Second purchase.	yes
亚马逊自营商品还是很放心的。	Amazon's own products are still very reassuring.	yes
换油的师傅说油品清亮，确实是好油 。	The master who changed the oil said the oil was bright; it was indeed a good oil.	yes
因为是第二次购买了。	Because it's the second time I've bought it.	yes
所以还是很放心的。	So it's still very reassuring.	yes
快递飞速，包装没有挑剔的地方，用了这个油，发动机声音明显下降。	The express delivery was fast, and there were no impeccable packaging. After using this oil, the engine sound dropped significantly.	yes
性价比不错，二百以下很难找到合成机油。	The cost performance ratio is good; it's hard to find synthetic engine oil under 200.	yes
支持星冠，支持胜牌，对车有效保护。	Support the Crown of Stars, support winning cards, and effectively protect the car.	yes
日本亚马逊因为客服问题导致买家的利益严重受损（8c的毛毛虫发货为8cm的毛毛虫）（8c=14cm，8cm=2c）	Buyers' interests have been seriously damaged by Amazon Japan due to customer service issues (8c caterpillars are shipped as 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)	yes
承认错误，但是一直在推诿，始终强调货物为第三方，不能约束第三方。	It admits mistakes, but continues to push back, always emphasizes that the goods are third parties and that third parties cannot be bound.	yes
订单编号：503-4265464-1830254。	Order ID: 503-4265464-1830254.	yes
我当初购买的页面尺码选项为7c，8，9c，当时觉得这就是个陷阱，打电话给日亚中文客服，明确告知8就是8c，但是等商品回到中国才发现，只有8cm，我觉得这完全是故意设下的陷阱来坑中国人（按照亚马逊的售后），现在查看页面已没有这个选项。	The page size options I originally purchased were 7c, 8,9c. At the time, I thought this was a trap. I called Japanese and Asian Chinese customer service and made it clear that 8 was 8c, but I only discovered it when the product came back to China. It was only 8cm. I think this was entirely a deliberate trap to trick Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service), but I don't have this option to view the page now.	yes
中方客服：很抱歉，给你带来损失了，我们给你两条路走：	Chinese customer service: I'm very sorry for the loss caused to you. We will give you two paths:	yes
1，你退货，买家承担所有运费。	1. You return the item and the buyer is responsible for all shipping costs.	yes
2，你不退货，我们补偿你1000日元。	2. If you don't return the item, we will reimburse you 1,000 yen.	yes
（我算一下账，鞋子4000多日元，算作200rmb，选择1，我没有鞋子，损失在200元。	(Let me do the math. The shoes are over 4,000 yen, calculated as 200rmb. Option 1, I don't have shoes, and I lost 200 yuan.	yes
选择2，我有鞋子，最后补偿了我2000日元，最后损失在150rmb 客服：我们已记录下来，我们会认真处理，次日回了封邮件，说我不接受中方客服调解，就这么完了。	Option 2. I have shoes. In the end, I was compensated 2,000 yen, and the final loss was 150RMB customer service: We have recorded it, we will handle it carefully. I replied to an email the next day saying that I would not accept the mediation from the Chinese customer service, and that's it.	yes
我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	I suggested: When the page I bought was a confusing option like 7c, 8, and 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me tell me that commonly used Japanese codes don't include c, similar to 140, but did you go to any other Caterpillar pages to read them?	yes
都有美码，日码混标的情况出现。	They all have US sizes, and there is a situation where Japanese sizes are mixed.	no
再说，你8cm为什么放在7c和9c中间，明明最小的尺码，你放那里算什么意思。	Also, why do you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, clearly the smallest size, what do you mean by putting it there.	no
中方客服：我们提供中文服务，但是不知道你要运回国，所以你的运费我们是不予理赔的。	Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know if you want to ship back home, so we won't pay for your shipping costs.	no
这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	I don't understand this logic either. I'm Japanese, and I also need Chinese customer service. Chinese people living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service either. Tourists to Japan don't have that effort to play international long distance, so the question is, who needs to call Amazon to buy Chinese phone numbers overseas is nothing more than someone like me.	no
亚马逊中文客服不就是方便了我们海淘的这些人吗？	Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just convenient for our Haitao people?	no
这次购买不是很满意	Not very satisfied with this purchase	yes
这是第二次从亚马逊上购买帮宝适尿布，曾经在宝宝2个月的时候买过一箱，选择了欧洲进口纸张的尿布，第一次购买经历还是比较满意的，宝宝整夜就用一张尿布，的确可以满足12个小时不换尿布。	This is the second time I've bought Pampabao's diapers from Amazon. I bought a box of diapers imported from Europe when my baby was 2 months old and chose paper diapers imported from Europe. I was quite satisfied with my first purchase experience. Babies use a diaper all night long, and it is indeed enough for 12 hours without changing diapers.	yes
但是这次购买L号的尿布，一箱里面有2包分开包装，打开后就觉得纸张比较松，跟进口帮宝适有明显区别，给宝宝用了之后，还算可以，没有漏尿也没有红疹等迹象。	However, when I bought L size diapers this time, there were 2 packs separately packed in one box. After opening, I felt that the paper was relatively loose. It was clearly different from imported Pampers. After using them for the baby, it was quite OK. There were no urine loss or signs of redness.	yes
但是到了第二包尿布，开始使用后宝宝的大腿内侧立马就出现了红疹，至今还没有褪去。	However, when it came to the second pack of diapers, the baby immediately developed a rash on the inside of the thigh after starting to use it, and it hasn't gone away yet.	yes
怀疑1箱里面的2包，质量还不一样啊。	I doubt the quality of the 2 packs in 1 box is not the same.	yes
以后应该不会继续购买了！	I probably won't continue to buy it in the future!	yes
希望重视包裹的运输保护	I want to pay attention to the shipping protection of my package	yes
这是我网购这么久以来，看到最差的一次包装运输，完全没有什么保护措施，缓冲泡沫，包裹缓冲层材料等，什么都没有。	This is the worst package I've seen in shopping online for so long. There are no protective measures at all, no cushioning foam, package buffer material, etc., nothing.	yes
就一个压变形的箱子。	It's just a deformed case.	yes
而且里面的软胶盒包装的，卡盒都压开了压到变形了。	Also, the soft plastic box inside the card case was squeezed open and pressed to the point where it was deformed.	yes
希望是正品 质量有保证，以后是不怎么敢亚马孙买东西的了。	I hope the quality of the genuine product is guaranteed; I won't dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future.	yes
宁愿国内贵一半，有保障点。	I'd rather be half as expensive at home and have guaranteed points.	yes
而且商品产品包装问题，我看评论2016年就有人评论过，到现在19年，还是老样子。	Also, there is a product packaging issue. I read the reviews in 2016 that someone has reviewed it. As of now, 19 years ago, it's still the same.	yes
说明亚马逊根本就不重视服务反馈这一块，和国内的京东、天猫等差太远了。	It shows that Amazon doesn't pay attention to service feedback at all; it's far worse than JD, Tmall, etc. in China.	yes
好看，但有点点小遗憾	Nice, but a bit of a pity	yes
整个杯子的颜色是我狠喜欢的，橘红色，虽然我家是男宝，但是还是觉得橘红配黄色很亮眼。	I really like the color of the whole cup. It's orange red. Even though I have a baby boy, I still think the orange red with yellow is very bright.	yes
比我想象的小一些，不过本来就是拿来带出门用的，所以还可以接受。	It's a little smaller than I thought, but I used it to take it outside, so it's acceptable.	yes
昨晚拿回家试了一下，瓶盖推开之后，吸管和盖子之间的距离太近了，因为吸管的位置是正向垂直的，所以儿子总是要把盖子上面的凸起含住喝水，觉得这个地方是否可以改进一下。	I took it home last night and tried it out. After the cap was pushed open, the distance between the straw and the lid was too close. Since the position of the straw is vertical, my son always has to keep the bulge on the lid in drinking water. I wonder if this area can be improved.	yes
看来其他牌子的吸管杯把吸管做的倾斜还是有道理的，小孩子的东西，真的就是在乎安全和舒适。	It seems that the inclination of the straws of other brands of sippy cups still makes sense. When it comes to kids' things, they really care about safety and comfort.	yes
轻便大容量	Lightweight and high capacity	yes
喜欢它轻便，开口大，就是两个独立的分隔袋对我来说有点多余，感觉不知道装什么好。	I like that it's lightweight and has a large opening, but the two separate dividers are a bit superfluous for me, and I don't know what to pack.	yes
买完发现海外购美亚上还有一只另一个牌子很类似的，才不到两百块。	After buying it, I discovered that there was another brand very similar to the one I bought overseas; it was less than 200 yuan.	yes
假货，假的特别厉害	Fakes, fakes are particularly bad	yes
亚马逊卖假货，我也是服了。	Amazon sells fake goods, so I am convinced.	yes
客服说因为用了所以不能退货，我没用怎么知道是假货。	The customer service said it couldn't be returned because it was used; I had no use how could I know it was a fake.	yes
因为信任，所以伤心，毕竟是抹脸的用品，真的去实体店买吧，认可贵一点。	I'm sad because of trust. After all, it's a face-wiping product. You should actually buy it at a physical store; I agree it's a little more expensive.	yes
因为是秒杀，所以没有看评论，我已经提交国家工商总局的电商平台了，我们一起维权吧。	I didn't read the comments because it was a flash sale. I've already submitted it to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let's defend our rights together.	yes
坏了？	Broken?	yes
假货？	Fake?	yes
总之悲剧。	Tragic in any case.	yes
用第二片的时候选的毛孔细致的，但是一打开就一股怪味，以为是正常的，因为没用过这款，然后往脸上贴的时候就整个受不了了，非常冲的味道，无法形容，熏到立马咳嗽了出来，眼睛也很痛，流眼泪，马上摘了去洗脸。	When I used the second tablet, I chose the one with fine pores, but I thought it was normal, because I hadn't used this one and then applied it to my face, I couldn't stand it. It had a very strong flavor. It was indescribable. I immediately coughed out when I smoked it. My eyes also hurt and shed tears. I immediately took it off and washed my face.	yes
不信邪又开了一片同款的，没有那么重的味道了，现在正在敷。	If you don't believe in evil, I bought another one of the same type. It doesn't have that heavy flavor anymore; I'm applying it now.	yes
回想起有点像发廊里劣质烫发水的味道。	Reminiscent of the smell a bit like poor quality perm water in a hair salon.	yes
真无法想象，难倒亚马逊自营的护肤品从此也得避而远之了吗？	It's unimaginable. Is it really that Amazon's own skincare products will have to be avoided from now on?	yes
奸商啊	A traitor	yes
当时购买的时候，活动页面上是说满99元赠送“三体全集”，收到货没有这个赠品，打客服电话说要给他们看当时活动的截图，问题是谁买东西还把网页截图保存啊，你们自己做过的活动，还需要顾客帮你们提供啊，各位买家下次要留个心眼，保存证据。	When I bought it at the time, the event page said that they would give away the “Complete Three Body Collection” for over 99 yuan. They called customer service and said they wanted to show them screenshots of the event at the time. The question was who bought things and saved screenshots of the website. The activities you did yourself still need help from customers. All buyers should keep a close eye on it next time and save the evidence.	yes
用后感受	Feelings after use	yes
第一次在亚马逊买东西，分别感受有几点，先来说下用完商品的感受吧，第一确实是无痛，也没有刺激味道的东西，总体来说很不错的，静等8分钟左右一擦就掉了，只是会有少量的汗毛渣在上面，不细看是看不出来的，所以说总体是不错的，至于之后都就用一次还要继续观察，继续用才会知道。	The first time I bought something on Amazon, I had a few different feelings. First, let's talk about the experience of using the product. The first one is really painless and doesn't have a pungent taste. Overall, it's very good. Wipe it off after about 8 minutes, but there will be a small amount of sweat residue on it, and you won't be able to see it if you don't take a close look, so overall it's good. As for the rest, you'll have to keep watching until you keep using it.	yes
反正我觉得这个东西确实不错。	Anyways, I think this stuff is really nice.	yes
第二从27号下单，12号收到货，总共15天也就是半个月，亚马逊的送货员服务态度也很好。	Second, I placed the order on the 27th and received the item on the 12th. It took a total of 15 days or half a month. Amazon's delivery service attitude was also very good.	yes
第三，亚马逊的什么黑色星期五就不要相信了，星期五下单，等了2天就便宜了接近12块钱，也就是我买成170多（加上运费什么的），有一种搞活动就提价格的感觉样。	Third, don't believe anything on Amazon's Black Friday. I placed an order on Friday and waited 2 days and it was close to 12 yuan cheaper. That is, I bought over 170 (plus shipping or something). There is a feeling that if you do an activity, you raise the price.	yes
客服说什么价格波动，我关注了10多天价格也就是这个样，波动也不大的。	What kind of price fluctuation did the customer service say? I've been paying attention to the price for more than 10 days. The price is just like this; it doesn't fluctuate much.	yes
价格实惠，日原产，有中文标签，带颗粒，绝对回购！	Affordable, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, with pellets, definitely bought back!	yes
膏体里带颗粒的，清爽感恰到好处，用后牙齿爽滑，上比某二手东强太多啦，那里说是进口的东西，可好多东西没有中文标签，不知从哪里批发的。	There are particles in the paste, and the feeling of freshness is just right. The teeth are smooth after use. They say they are imported, but many of them don't have Chinese labels, so I don't know where they are sold from.	yes
以后只要亚马逊有的，绝不再去二手东。	In the future, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to a second-hand store.	yes
给个建议，亚马逊的app 上晒单怎么有时晒不了，希望能改进一些应用，会做的越来越好的！	Here's a suggestion, why can't I post a list on the Amazon app sometimes? I hope some apps can be improved, and they'll do better and better!	yes
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	Over the years of excellence, it's getting worse and worse, and there's no quality of service to speak of at all!	yes
垃圾卓越不顾及客户需求 下订单的时候特别配送时间19:00-22:00。	The garbage excellency does not take into account customer needs. The special delivery time is 19:00-22:00.	yes
因家里有术后卧床不方便的老人在，所以只有晚上可以方便收件。	Since there are elderly people at home who cannot be easily bedridden after surgery, it is only convenient to receive packages at night.	yes
结果竟然中午12点就直接上门送了，也不事先电话告知。	As a result, it was actually delivered directly to the door at 12:00 noon, and they didn't call in advance.	yes
如果配送时间是你们快递员随心所欲的想几点就几点送，何必假惺惺弄个时间让客户选择？	If the delivery time is whatever your courier wants it to be delivered at whatever time they want, why pretend to let the customer choose the time?	yes
如果自己的物流没办法保证服务的，那就干脆不要做电商了！	If your logistics can't guarantee service, then don't do e-commerce at all!	yes
让一个身上3处伤口的老人下床开门收快递还要找零钱付费！	To get an old man with 3 wounds on his body to get out of bed and open the door to receive the package, he still has to find change to pay!	yes
明明订单上有联系电话！	There is clearly a contact number on the order!	yes
从头到底也没有人来电话联系一下给个解释！	From the beginning, no one even called to give me an explanation!	yes
卓越网所谓的投诉客服就是一帮子外地人在那里装样子，敷衍你的投诉然后给你一个所谓的答复。	Excellence Network's so-called complaint customer service is a bunch of outsiders pretending to be there, misleading your complaint and then giving you a so-called response.	yes
不会有任何改变或者补偿！	There will be no changes or compensation!	no
之前也是遇到这样子了类似配送时间不对的问题也就忍了，但这次无法忍受，太过分了！	I've run into issues like this before with incorrect delivery times, so I can't bear it, but this time it's unbearable; it's just too much!	no
新书买的预售到货后竟然封面和封底是反的，这样子明显得质量问题就这样子闭眼把书发给顾客了？	When I bought a new book, the cover and back cover were actually reversed after the pre-sale arrived. This clearly caused the quality problem, so they closed their eyes and sent the book to the customer?	no
留言差评也不会有人来联系你。	Leave a bad review and no one will contact you.	no
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	Over the years of excellence, it's getting worse and worse, and there's no quality of service to speak of at all!	no
不会再在卓越上花一毛钱。	You won't spend another dime on excellence.	no
图片质量实在不能接受	The picture quality is really not acceptable	yes
作为“古地图集”这样的标题，本书在图片的选择、排版、印刷上实在令人难以接受，有些图片甚至有马赛克，模糊到无法辨识。	As a title like “Ancient Atlas,” the book's selection, layout, and printing of the images is really difficult to accept. Some of the images even have mosaics, so blurry that they are unrecognizable.	yes
即便本书不是专业的地图册，即便是小画幅插图，也应该对得起目录中祖先留下来的洋洋大观的中古文献资料！	Even if this book isn't a professional atlas, even if it's a small frame illustration, it should be worthy of the ancient documents left by our ancestors in the catalogue!	yes
（况且很多图片是可以从相关行业资源中获取清晰的原始文件的），用这样的图片来拼凑图书与不使用图片有何差别？	(Moreover, many images can be obtained from clear original documents from relevant industry resources), what is the difference between using such images to piece together a book and not using images?	yes
！我为这样的治学精神感到遗憾。	! I am sorry for this academic spirit.	yes
文字方面不予评价，方家各有分辨。	There are no reviews in terms of writing; each member of the Fang family has their own differences.	yes
整体2星。	Overall 2 stars.	yes
高二的时候看的这本书当时只是抱着无聊看看玩的心态，感觉这样的书自己应该不会沉迷吧，毕竟起点的网文以往还是不太吸引我的。	When I was in my sophomore year of high school, I read this book with the mentality of just reading and having fun. I think I probably wouldn't be addicted to this kind of book myself. After all, the starting online article wasn't very appealing to me in the past.	yes
然后...就掉坑里了。	Then... it fell into the pit.	yes
按着这个剧情来说，整本书都是比较轻松愉快的，前部分叶修还在网游里的时候，即使是公会之间勾心斗角，也因为往往被叶神狗血，搞得一点也不沉重。	According to this plot, the whole book is quite relaxed and enjoyable. In the first part, when Ye Xiu was still in an online game, even if it was an intriguing fight between guilds, it wasn't heavy at all because he was often bloodshot by Ye Shen Gou.	yes
至于到了比赛的部分，写出了时代的变迁新旧交替的一点点心酸之感（可能是我多愁善感）。	As for the competition section, I wrote about the changing times and the alternation of old and new, a bit sad (I'm probably sentimental).	yes
看整部书花了我高二许多学习时间，可是就是停不下来。	Reading the whole book took me a lot of time studying in my sophomore year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.	yes
全职对人物和感情线的描写让人十分惊艳，有的人物只是偶尔带过，也会给人留下很深的影响，像比较重点描写的角色叶修黄少天苏沐橙都有大量的粉丝，而不在写作中心的角色例如江波涛楚云秀等等也十分找人喜欢，在一个电竞的爽文中竟然让人找不到一个让人讨厌至极的人物，这是全职在人物描写上的成功。	The full time portrayal of characters and feelings is amazing. Some characters have only been taken occasionally, and they also leave a deep influence on people. For example, Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mu Cheng, the characters that are not in the writing center, such as Jiang Botao, Chu Yunxiu, etc. are also very popular. In a cool e-sports article, it's hard to find a person who is extremely annoying. This is a success in character portrayal on full time.	yes
而在感情线上，全职也没有一般网文所令人诟病的后宫佳丽三千万要么美女要么腐的毛病，全文所有人的感情，都有一个共同的地方就是他们喜欢着荣耀这个游戏，并且大都想要堂堂正正的胜利。	However, on the emotional side, the 30 million harem beauty that has been criticized by the average online article is either beautiful or corrupt. Full article What everyone has in common is that they love this game of glory, and most of them want to win in a dignified manner.	yes
小计量有却没有什么大阴谋，每个人看上去都那么单纯可爱。	There was a small amount but no big conspiracy; everyone looked so simple and cute.	yes
这或许也是为什么全职没有什么令人讨厌的角色。	That's probably why there aren't any annoying characters full time.	yes
全职的IP很大，也归功于此。	The full time IP is huge, and this is also due to that.	yes
撇开网文这个文化现象不谈，全职不失为一本不错的书。	Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of online writing, a full time job is a great book.	no
多少他真的会给人提供一些热血，一点点感动。	How much does he really give people some passion, a little bit of emotion.	no
今年4月份全职要动漫化。	I want to animate my full time in April this year.	no
其实想要买齐这套书很久了，碍于永远钱包不够厚都没狠下心下手，然后想要买的时候就发现，tb上简直是假货猖獗，其实全职最近出了另一个版本，封面图吧我自己是蛮喜欢的，但还是打算先买老的版本，所以就在亚马逊上看了看，一次性买下来了一套。	It's actually been a long time since I wanted to buy all of these books. Since my wallet wasn't thick enough, I discovered that fakes are rampant on TB. In fact, I recently released another version full time. I really like the cover picture, but I'm still planning to buy the old version first, so I just looked at it on Amazon and bought one set in one go.	no
接下来简单说一下货的情况。	Next, let's talk briefly about the condition of the goods.	no
●第四本的塑封没有，但书是新的。	●The fourth book doesn't have plastic wrap, but the book is new.	no
●第十七本塑封是在但是被打开了，书的质感也很奇怪感觉没有其他的硬。	●The seventeenth plastic cover was, however, opened, and the texture of the book was also very strange, and it didn't feel any other hard material.	no
●第23本和第十七本情况一样，但是也比第十七本硬，但十分的旧。	●The 23rd book is in the same situation as the 17th one, but it's also harder than the 17th one, but it's quite old.	no
●个别几本书的出版社不同好像第23和17就是同一个出版社，和其他的不同。	●The publishing houses for a few books are different; it seems that No. 23 and No. 17 are the same publishing house, which is different from the others.	no
●整体来讲还算满意，24本很大一箱，很满足。	●Overall, I am quite satisfied. I am very satisfied with 24 books in a big box.	no
落寞的小狮子	Lonely little lion	yes
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as “The Lost Corner,” but it turned out there was still a lot of text!	yes
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	I read it three times before I finished reading this book for my kids. It's a little lion that can shoot, a little lion that loves fruit juice and gummies.	yes
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	When I saw the story of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urban people are a bit unreceptive to this arrangement of being eaten by animals.	yes
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	Seeing at the end of the day, this little lion, who has succeeded in human society, has lost himself. He is no longer a complete lion, nor a complete person.	yes
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	In the end, there was only the back of the little lion; I don't know where he went.	yes
可能多年以后，这个小狮子的形象还留在长大了的小朋友的印象中，在某一天不经意的时候被想起，或许对她会有触动或是启发。	Perhaps many years from now, the image of this little lion still remains in the impression of a grown child. Being reminded of her when she was carelessly one day may have moved or inspired her.	yes
性价比很高的作品集	A very cost-effective portfolio of works	yes
1、以前还不知道TASCHEN，最近买了不少他们的书，原因就是太强悍，不论是选题还是制作本身。	1. I didn't know about TASCHEN before. I bought quite a few of their books recently. The reason is that they are too aggressive, whether it's the topic selection or the production itself.	yes
本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	There have been 3 editions of this work. The biggest version, like the complete Michelangelo collection, is close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the medium version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; while this edition is the smallest, two-volume edition with a bookcase.	yes
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	I personally think it's also acceptable. First, the price is cheap, and the 700-plus pages are split into two, making it easy to read as a paperback book; secondly, unlike the Michelangelo Complete Collection, paintings are the main body; Leonardo da Vinci's black and white manuscript accounts for most of the time. For readers with limited budgets and non-art professionals, this edition is the most cost-effective for readers who appreciate paintings and manuscripts.	yes
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	2. The explanation of the painting section is excellent. There is composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as the last dinner), but I don't know if it's printing or book size issues. Some of the shadows are too deep in some counties, so I can't see the details. It's a bit of a pity.	yes
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	3. Compared to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer in content.	yes
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius; the latter has a wide range of fields and high achievements, which is not enough to be described as a genius.	yes
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	If I had only seen paintings before I could only experience half of Leonardo da Vinci, I would be completely speechless after reading the manuscript.	yes
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Garbage, who buys who regrets it!	yes
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	I've never given a bad review. This is really rubbish and a waste of money, just give me a reason!	yes
1.走时不准，突然变成1月1号，时间归零了。	1. The walking time was not accurate. Suddenly it became January 1st, and the time went back to zero.	yes
2.劣质皮带，都不是硅胶的，带了手腕过敏起泡。	2. The poor quality straps are not silicone, and they are blistering on the wrist due to allergies.	yes
3.经常连不上手机。	3. I often can't connect to my phone.	yes
4.续航只有五天。	4. The battery life is only five days.	yes
5.睡眠检测不显示，时间是0。	5. The sleep test does not show up, the time is 0.	yes
6.不防水。	6. Not waterproof.	yes
7.其他。	7. Others.	yes
物流太慢	Logistics is too slow	yes
显示10月16号到，结果21号才收到，差评！	It shows that it arrived on October 16, but the results were only received on the 21st. Bad review!	yes
快递太差，亚马逊上买东西本来就慢，没想到会这么慢！	Courier delivery is so bad. Buying things on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow!	yes
总体满意	Overall satisfaction	yes
之前一开始还担心相机的包装，这次还好，里面有充气包，相机三码一致，也能在官网注册，快门次数0，其余的就只能等时间检验了 。	I was worried about the camera's packaging at the beginning. This time it's fine. There's an inflatable bag inside. The camera's size 3 is the same, and you can also register on the official website. The number of shutters is 0, so the rest can only be tested in time.	yes
发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	The delivery was pretty fast. I'm complaining about the courier here. Valuable items were placed in the porch. He walked so fast that I couldn't unpack and inspect them in front of him. I was really speechless about this.	yes
商家发货前做到了为客户着想:)	The merchant did it for the customer's sake before shipping:)	yes
商家比较负责，专门打电话问所用相机的屏幕尺寸，确实替客户着想了。	The merchant is quite responsible. They specifically call to ask about the screen size of the camera they are using, which is really for the customer's sake.	yes
发货速度也快。	The shipping was also fast.	yes
金刚膜贴上去也挺合适和管用的。	The diamond film is also very suitable and effective when applied.	yes
电池充不满	Battery charge is not satisfied	yes
机器确实不错，想问下怎么第一次充电起就充不满啊，充电指示灯一直红色	The machine is really nice. I want to know why it doesn't charge enough the first time it's charged. The charging indicator is always red	yes
目前找不到亚马逊官方反馈渠道，所以只能在商品评价里反馈	There is currently no official Amazon feedback channel, so you can only give feedback in product reviews	yes
1. 在 3 月 29 号，通过预购途径使用 31 元购买了此书，显示 3 月 31 号会推送到设备上，此时亚马逊官网上还无法预览该书（因为还未发布）；	1. On March 29, I purchased this book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, showing that it will be delivered to devices on March 31. At this time, it is not possible to preview the book on Amazon's official website (because it hasn't been published yet);	yes
2. 3 月 31 号推送到设备上的书，内容是空白，只有敬请期待，而亚马逊上该书电子版降价到了 18 元；	2. The book was delivered to the device on March 31. The content is blank, just stay tuned, but the price of the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced to 18 yuan;	yes
3. 这两天反复尝试将设备上的下载的空白的书进行删除，再次同步，都无法获取到包含实际内容的电子版《商业的本质》，但是看到亚马逊官网已经可以预览该书。	3. After two days of repeated attempts to delete the blank book I downloaded on my device and synced it again, I was unable to obtain the electronic version of “The Essence of Business” with actual content, but I saw that it was already possible to preview the book on Amazon's official website.	yes
目前我有几点感想	How many thoughts do I have at the moment	yes
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	1. The price issue isn't actually the most important one; the key is how to replace the blank book on the Kindle with the actual content now, rather than the “stay tuned” if you download it forever	yes
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	2. You probably won't buy the book you pre-ordered in the future. After all, if you skip your ticket and download another book with empty content, the procedure seems very complicated;	yes
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	3. I hope Amazon will provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues. If you have questions about the download or use of e-books, you can have local feedback (work orders, online customer service are all OK, you can refer to how to do it on the official Microsoft store)	yes
不是很推荐阅读	I don't really recommend reading	yes
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see how I felt after reading it from my memory.	yes
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	This book is not so much a collection of short stories as it is a collection of fragments of love from life.	yes
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The pen tone of this book is extremely bland. It is as bland as plain as plain water. The wording takes simplicity to the extreme, and the plot is as quiet and bland as the street on a summer afternoon.	yes
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Every short story is a snapshot of a short period of time in an ordinary life. There is no beginning, no end.	yes
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	Finally, they were collected together and titled “What Do We Talk About When We Talk About Love”.	yes
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I think this collection of novels, and its title, is like a form of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not only the sorrow and joy of the stage; the sea is rotten and stony in urban legends; love is not only the above nor should it be represented by the above; love is also a life as plain as water. Every day is boring and tasteless, there is also a sense of frustration with life, an escape from reality, and the future is at a loss.	yes
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	As you read this book, you may think of the quarrelsome couples bickering around you, the boring marriages of people you know, and unsatisfying feelings.	yes
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	This is the reason I don't recommend reading it. From an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are completely tasteless. Unless your life is turbulent or as sweet as living in a candy castle, the feeling you have to read is that it's not weird or boring.	yes
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	However, in terms of depth of thought, the daily plot did not brighten people's eyes or expand one's thoughts and horizons (this is different from Marquez's “Love in the Time of Cholera”), nor did the short clip discuss any issues, such as what kind of mistakes caused the failure of love?	yes
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	What are the reasons for the breakdown of the main character's marriage?	no
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	So I don't recommend reading this book; it doesn't make much sense if you don't read it.	no
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	The author expressed his ideas more through techniques and genres than the storyline, which is also the reason for the poor reading experience of this book.	no
适合粗读,不能细看。	Good for rough reading; don't look closely.	yes
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	The logic of this book is good, but the content isn't full enough.	yes
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	It explains what many sales theories are and why, but they are very weak in how to do it; they only indicate the direction but do not give specific practices.	yes
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	Plus, the book feels like a piece of work.	yes
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	Examples include those at home and abroad; well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople, and famous unknown people.	yes
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	I don't know if the story was written for examples; it would be more convincing if I gave examples from the author's own experiences.	yes
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	It changed over and over in terms of whether it was a customer or a customer.	yes
标题上还是顾客,正文中就变成客户了。	It's still a customer in the title, but it becomes a customer in the main text.	yes
电子书中还出现了错别字、标点符号缺失、编号错误的问题。	E-books also have typos, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering issues.	yes
总之,这本书作为理论入门是个不错的选择,但对于已经从事销售工作想要提高销售水平的人就不太适用了。	Anyway, this book is a good introduction to theory, but it's not suitable for people who already work in sales and want to improve their sales standards.	yes
快速了解互联网金融的导读书	A guide book to quickly understand internet finance	yes
这本书很浅，可以说只是一个入门课，可以帮助大家快速了解互联网金融的全貌，但要深入了解，还是要按图索骥，自己去深挖。	This book is very short. It can be said that it is just an introductory course. It can help you quickly understand the full picture of internet finance, but if you want to understand it in depth, you still have to follow the map and dig deeper on your own.	yes
且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	Also, the book was written quite early. The later Alipay WeChat subsidy war to cultivate user habits hasn't been mentioned yet. I'm afraid the current share of third-party payments isn't as small as stated in the book.	yes
现在好多人外出吃饭都是带个手机就好，商家也因为银行流水太高的原因，弃用银联了。	Now many people just need to bring a cell phone when they go out to eat, and merchants are abandoning UnionPay because bank turnover is too high.	yes
但还是非常感谢作者写出这本入门书，看得出作者起码有多年的金融观察经验，对国内外的金融发展史都十分熟悉，所以才能写成如此通俗易懂的内容。	However, I am very grateful to the author for this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, which is why the content is so easy to understand.	yes
写高大空很容易，难的是写的通俗易懂。	It's easy to write high in the sky; the hard part is that it's easy to understand in plain language.	yes
欣赏你，更想让你知道！	I appreciate you and want to let you know more!	yes
决定一个人工作满意度的第一要素不是薪水高低，而是在工作中是否得到了足够重视和赏识。	The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the salary, but whether they receive enough attention and recognition at work.	yes
根据马斯洛需求层次理论，在人的基本生存需要得到满足后，最迫切的就是心理需要的满足——希望被理解、被肯定、被赏识。	According to Maslow's hierarchical theory of needs, after a person's basic survival needs are satisfied, the most urgent thing is to satisfy their psychological needs — the desire to be understood, acknowledged, and appreciated.	yes
确实，对于国人来说，大部分是“爱你在心口难开”，即便是怀有爱、感激与赞赏也是默默放在心里不会说出来。	Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them are “I love you and it's hard to open your heart”; even if they have love, gratitude, and appreciation, they keep silent and don't say it in their hearts.	yes
作者在本书中阐述了五种赞赏的语言：肯定的言辞、精心时刻、服务的行为、称心的礼物、身体接触。	The author describes the five languages of appreciation in this book: affirmative words, careful moments, acts of service, satisfying gifts, and physical contact.	yes
我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	What I think is important is not that you know exactly what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use these five languages from the heart to appreciate and thank the people around you, whether family, friends, or colleagues.	yes
其实越是亲密的人越需要赞赏和感恩，这样我们的生活才会变得更加美好。	In fact, the closer we are, the more we need appreciation and gratitude, so our lives will be better.	yes
学会赞赏，企业也能在一定程度上挽留住人才，降低辞职率。	Learn to appreciate that companies can also retain talents to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.	yes
感谢译者给我们带来了精彩的国外的思想和世界。	Thank you to the translators for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and the world.	yes
由于中西方文化背景等原因，语言之间或多或少会存在差异，如果有机会能看到作者原版相信会收获更多。	Due to the cultural background of China and the West, there will be more or less differences between languages. If I had the chance to see the author's original, I believe I would gain more.	yes
再次谢谢作者和译者以及编辑们的辛勤劳动！	Thanks again to the authors, translators, and editors for all their hard work!	no
疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	Suspected to be a counterfeit product, please review it strictly by Amazon	yes
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, not even as much as a roadside stall product. There is no weight, no bar code, and the ten-bag package is loose and broken, which is not a characteristic of a qualified product at all; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon; it is entirely a quality issue; the merchant is advised to polish their eyes and reject poor quality products; additional: I also bought Heart Print. The supermarket is 23 yuan/10 rolls, and several comparison photos have been added to further verify the hypocrisy of this product. In order to give consumers a clearer reference and avoid financial losses and unrelenting feelings Hurry up!	yes
再度期望亚马逊能够一丝不苟，严把商品源头。	Once again, we expect Amazon to be meticulous and strictly control the origin of products.	yes
马马虎虎的产品，和期望有差距	A sloppy product that is far from what is expected	yes
优点：	Advantages:	yes
1. 大品牌，价格便宜。	1. Big brands, cheap prices.	yes
优点2：电机和刀片都是PANASONIC保证的，使用起来也还OK，但是和我期望有差距。	Advantage 2: The motor and blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and it's OK to use, but there's a gap with my expectations.	yes
缺点：	Cons:	yes
1. 充电没有指示灯，这个最基本你的电源指示都省下了，估计购买300元产品的客户，在松下PANASONIC的眼里，也是施舍，毫无尊重。	1. There is no indicator for charging. This is the most basic power indicator for you. It is estimated that customers who buy 300 yuan products are also charity and have no respect in the eyes of Panasonic.	yes
2. 有强烈的异味 充电时候，哪怕仅仅充电10分钟，就可以闻到强烈的塑胶燃烧的那种味道。	2. There is a strong smell when charging, even after only 10 minutes of charging, you can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.	yes
办公室试用了1天，搞的全屋子都是这种塑胶味道。	The office was tested for 1 day, and the whole house smelled like this kind of plastic.	yes
和我之前用过的同价位的飞利浦PHILIPS相比，虽然多了个刀头，但是松下这款产品，质量真是对不起消费者了。	Compared to the Philips PHILIPS I've used before at the same price, it has more blades, but the quality of this Panasonic product is really sorry for consumers.	yes
小包装	small package	yes
收到快递一看上面写着电商版就知道又掉坑里了，比超市买的小了好些，应该是M，跟商品介绍上面的图片包装不一样，所谓新版吧。	As soon as I received the courier and read the e-commerce version on it, I knew it had fallen into the hole again. It's better than the one I bought at the supermarket. It's probably M. It's not the same packaging as the picture on the product description. It's called the new version.	yes
三颗星是怪自己马虎没看清楚商品规格，你卖M码电商版我没意见，你货不对版是几个意思？	The three stars are blaming you for not being able to read the product specifications clearly. I have no opinion if you sell the M size e-commerce version. What do you mean by the wrong edition?	yes
电商套路深，有时间还是去超市买了。	The e-commerce routine is deep, so I went to the supermarket to buy it when I had time.	yes
就酱紫。	Just the sauce is purple.	yes
味道不喜欢	I don't like the taste	yes
小孩很不喜欢牙膏的味道，每次都说辣，也许用别的词形容才更贴切，小孩的词库里暂时只有这个词。	Kids really don't like the smell of toothpaste. They say it spicy every time. Maybe it's more appropriate to use other words to describe it. For the time being, this is the only word in children's thesaurus.	yes
搞活动时候买的，很便宜，所以也不好意思给差评了，四星吧，不过不会再买了。	I bought it when I was at an event. It's very cheap, so I'm too embarrassed to give it a bad review. 4 stars, but I won't buy it again.	yes
正品哟 包装好	Genuine, well packaged	yes
包装很完整，里面加了充气袋，没有网上评论的只有光秃秃一个产品的样子。	The package is very complete, with an inflatable bag inside. The only thing that has no online reviews is the product that looks like a bare bald product.	yes
瓶子外包装上还有一层塑料膜像图片上描述的一样，快递也很快，拍下第二天就来了。	There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle as described in the picture, and the courier was also fast. It arrived the next day after shooting.	yes
是正品，只是没货了，不知道什么时候再上架。	It's a genuine product, but it's out of stock. I don't know when it will be on the shelves again.	yes
糟心的一次购物体验	A bad shopping experience	yes
黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	The order was placed at the time of the Black Friday. As a result, I had waited a long time for the package to be signed. When I asked my colleagues around me, they all said they didn't help. They quickly contacted the courier company, but they said they needed the sender to initiate the inquiry, contacted Amazon customer service, and waited for more than 10 days. Finally, it became clear that the courier had been mistakenly delivered to someone else, and I didn't know it had been overused. Overall, it's pretty bad	yes
错误的配图	Wrong picture	yes
我以为自己能够收到图1这样的耳机，没想到却收到了图2这样的耳机，图物不一致也就算了，耳机左右声音大小不一又是什么意思？	I thought I could get headphones like Figure 1, but I didn't expect to get headphones like Figure 2. Forget the inconsistent pictures. What does the difference in volume between the left and right earphones mean?	yes
虽然名称都是一样的，但还是希望大家能够小心注意，另外还请亚马逊负责人及时更换正确的配图，万分感谢。	Although the names are all the same, I hope everyone can pay careful attention. Also, please ask the person in charge of Amazon to change the correct images in a timely manner. Thank you very much.	yes
操作系统一般般	The operating system is average	yes
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	I've been using it for a while. Overall, the picture is OK, and I don't feel any difference. The system is clearly a bit slow to boot, and I can't make any good settings. There's even no need to comment on the software that comes with it. The response speed is even more average. Compared to my colleagues, that's not an order of magnitude.	yes
看评论说很人性化的设计，我没有找到哪里人性化，遥控器这个常用的上下左右，返回键设计的位置实在是不敢恭维。	I read the reviews saying that the design is very user-friendly. I haven't found anything user-friendly. The position of the remote control, the commonly used up, down, left, left, and right, return button design is really unflattering.	yes
所以呢，就当个电视吧，再外加电视盒之类的用吧。	So, let's just use it as a TV, plus something like a TV box.	yes
降价太厉害了	The price reduction is too great	yes
降价太厉害了，一百多入现在99！	The price drop is so great that over 100 is now 99!	yes
在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	I've accumulated a lot of unrated orders on Amazon, so I've always used a copied passage as review content.	yes
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I use this passage to review, it means that this product has at least 85 points.	yes
而比较差的产品，我绝对不会偷懒到复制粘贴评价，这样其他消费者在购买的时候会作为参考，而商家也会因此改进商品质量。	However, I would never be too lazy to copy and paste reviews of poor products, so other consumers will use them as a reference when purchasing, and merchants will improve product quality as a result.	yes
低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	Good line at a low price, that's enough if you don't have a fever!	yes
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	It's such a cheap cable, but it must have met the HDMI certification standards. Compared to the domestic Akihabara dog crap (they are all twice as expensive), the wire is thick and relatively soft. There is no noise in the 7-meter transmission. There is no noise in the 7-meter transmission, so I will think twice about the low price line in the future!	yes
东西还可以，但是亚马逊的售后服务真的比其他网站差太多了	The stuff is OK, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites	yes
下单后发现下错了，但是取消订单已经取消不了，网页联系在线客服一直显示错误链接，联系不上。	After placing the order, I discovered that there was an error, but I couldn't cancel the order. The website kept showing an error link when contacting online customer service, and I couldn't get in touch.	yes
到货后送货员给我打电话，我说我不要了，想取消订单的没取消成功，派送员就拿回去了，说先给我签收上，让我申请退货。	The delivery person called me after it arrived. I said I didn't want it anymore. If I wanted to cancel the order, the delivery person took it back and said I would sign for it first and let me apply for a return.	yes
申请退货时才告知食品类一旦签收不能退货，没办法打电话给亚马逊客服，也是一样说法，签收不能退货。	When I applied for a return, I was only told that once the food item was signed for, there was no way to call Amazon customer service. It's also a similar statement; the order cannot be returned.	yes
我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I've bought items that cannot be returned by JD and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc. I contacted customer service and they all returned them. Moreover, JD's diapers taste too bad after opening and I still contacted customer service to return them; it won't work when I arrived at your Amazon.	yes
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	Rules are dead, people are alive. Contact your customer service. How do you handle it?	yes
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	Tell me I'll either take it for myself or let the delivery person buy it themselves. It's not easy for them to be a delivery person. Why should I make someone pay to buy something they didn't buy?	yes
行，我也不退了，我自己收下了，但是必须给你们的服务打1分	OK, I'm not going to give it back either. I took it myself, but I have to rate your service 1 point	yes
劝大家不要白花钱	Advise everyone not to spend money in vain	yes
首先满怀期待购买，觉得都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧，收到了以后看包装觉得还可以，个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感，吃到嘴里完全没有味道，寡淡无味，咬开来果肉一圈是暗黄色就是坏了那种，好坏参着卖的，能吃的也就不到三分之一，劝大家不要买，也不便宜，质量太差了！	First of all, I'm looking forward to buying it. I think the Dole brand's one shouldn't be too bad. After I received it, I think it's OK. It's pretty good, but one of the boxes is basically soft, and I can't see it on the outside. If you eat it, it doesn't taste at all, it's light and tasteless. If you bite off the dark yellow color of the pulp, it's just bad. It's not even one-third of what you can eat. It's not cheap, the quality is so bad!	yes
吃一堑长一智，以后再也不在电商买水果了！	Once you eat it, you'll never buy fruit on e-commerce again!	yes
产品防伪标识在哪里	Where is the product security label	yes
瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的，从外包装袋看，感觉蹂躏的程度让人揪心，毕竟是食物类的包装太简单了，而且还是属于国际购的，还有没看到什么明显的防伪标识标志，开瓶非常轻松，关键是盖内的一层蜂蜜直接从里面冒出来了，有开口几乎是没有什么粘连性，外国产品都是这样的吗？	The bottom of the bottle has a severe indentation, which must have been caused by a strong impact. Judging from the outer packaging, the extent of the damage is worrisome. After all, the food packaging is too simple, and it's also purchased internationally. I haven't seen any obvious anti-counterfeiting signs. The point is that the layer of honey inside the lid comes directly out of the inside, and the opening has almost no adhesiveness. Are all foreign products like this?	yes
生在中国的我有点不理解了。	Being born in China, I don't understand it.	yes
应该是正品吧？	It's supposed to be a genuine product, right?	yes
还有拍下时提示二十几号到，这个是14号收到的，我第一次在这里海外购，只是把自己的疑惑写下来，或许这都是正常的？	Also, when I took the picture, I was prompted to arrive on the 20th. I received this on the 14th. My first overseas purchase here. I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe this is all normal?	yes
提货服务有待改进	Pickup service needs to be improved	yes
我一共买了5份提货券，在提取时，第一次预约提取3份，结果只寄过来2份，经过多方沟通才确认是漏发、答应后需补发；第二次预约，刚好赶上休息日，网站和微信均无提示需要在工作日预约，造成了不必要的恐慌，建议以后改善。	I bought a total of 5 delivery vouchers. At the time of collection, I made an appointment to pick up 3 copies for the first time. After multiple communication, it was confirmed that they had been omitted and that they needed to be reissued after approval; the second reservation, just in time for a day off, the website and WeChat didn't prompt me to make an appointment on a weekday, causing unnecessary panic and suggested improvements later.	yes
不错的购物	Nice shopping	yes
东西好评！	The stuff was well received!	yes
还是比较相信亚马逊自营的东西，现在海外购以后很方便，从国外买回来物流时间比国内也就多几天，不得不说亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的，比走转运要快很多，所以现在很多东西都在海外购上买。	I still trust Amazon's own products. Now it's very convenient after buying overseas. The logistics time for buying back from abroad is only a few days longer than at home. I have to say that Amazon's customs clearance ability from overseas purchases to domestic ones is still very strong. It's much faster than transit, so now a lot of things are bought overseas.	yes
希望国内商品的质量和价格能够更好一些，很多东西都是国内产的，但是出去转一圈买回来比在国内还便宜，希望改进。	I hope the quality and price of domestic products will be better. Many things are made domestically, but going out and buying them back is cheaper than at home, so I hope for improvements.	yes
垃圾	garbage	yes
看到这样的包裹，试问大家:觉不觉得是路边的垃圾?	Seeing a package like this, let's ask everyone: Do you think it's roadside trash?	yes
一个塑料易碎的包装，就用一个塑料袋从所谓的德国发过来，这样的包装是负责的吗?	A plastic package that is fragile is sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag. Is this kind of packaging responsible?	yes
我看这样的包装是装垃圾一样的，购买这个产品，包装及其简陋，没有任何防止破损的措施，就一个简单的塑料袋包装，到手后，包裹完全变形了，里面的物品也有破损。	I think this kind of packaging is like garbage. When I bought this product, the packaging was rudimentary. There were no measures to prevent damage. It was just a simple plastic bag. When I got it, the package was completely deformed, and the items inside were also damaged.	yes
如果我只是碰到一个这样的，我认了，买了几个都是这样子，找亚马逊客服，客服就说可以退，但运费垫付，然后运费以礼品卡的形式返回给我。	If I only came across one like this, I agree. I bought a few of them all like this. When I called Amazon customer service, the customer service said it was refundable, but the shipping fee was paid in advance, and then the shipping fee was returned to me in the form of a gift card.	yes
我试问一下，我用现金支付运费，你们给我返礼品卡，这是要我自己买你们礼品卡就直说啊，还要自己把产品邮寄到德国仓库，这不是买个产品受罪啊!	Let me just ask, I used cash to pay for shipping, and you gave me back the gift card. If I had to buy your gift card myself, go ahead and mail the product to a German warehouse. This isn't a crime for buying a product!	yes
而我一直跟客服说，出现这样的问题是谁的责任，客服却半句不说是他们的责任，连半句责任都不敢担当，这样的售后服务还有什么保障呢? 一句话:认栽!但我估计我这个评价，亚马逊都不会给公布的机会，直接回删除!	And I've always said to customer service, who is responsible for this kind of problem, but the customer service doesn't say it's their responsibility; they don't even dare to take on half a sentence of responsibility. What guarantees are there for this kind of after-sales service? In a word: I don't know how to plant it! But I don't think Amazon will give me a chance to publish my review and just delete it!	yes
质量很好5星，物流很差	The quality is very good 5 stars, the logistics are very poor	yes
1，质量很好，秒杀的，价格适中，物超所值。	1. Very good quality, super cheap, affordable, great value for money.	yes
2，结实、用料足、焊点牢固、表面处理得当、颜色很好。	2. Strong, sufficient material, firm solder joints, proper surface treatment, and good color.	yes
3，物流是硬伤，3号下的单，11号到的。	3. The logistics were difficult. The order was placed on the 3rd and arrived on the 11th.	yes
4，如果亚马逊没有标注预计到货时间是2月7号，我或许会很满意。	4. If Amazon doesn't indicate that the estimated delivery time is February 7, I would probably be satisfied.	yes
5，但标注了预期到货时间，就相当于给用户一个承诺，当承诺无法兑现的时候，用户很难受。	5. However, marking the expected delivery time is equivalent to giving the user a promise. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user feels very bad.	yes
6，如果你没有给予承诺的把握，请不要做出承诺。	6. If you're not sure about giving a promise, don't make a promise.	yes
7，实际上，我非常在意商家做出的承诺。	7. Actually, I really care about the promises made by merchants.	yes
8，所以，我打了低分。	8. So, I gave a low score.	yes
金线会掉色	The gold thread will fade	yes
效果还是有的，但感觉是否明显，就看个人咯，或是心理作用。	The effect is still there, but whether it feels obvious depends on the individual or psychological effect.	yes
有一点不太好的，就是金色的线，本来设计出来是觉得好看，但实际上，这个金线会掉色，往车上一放，如果拿动几次，手上，和车上，会有一些金粉。	One thing that's not very good is the gold thread. It was originally designed to look good, but in reality, this gold thread will fade and be placed on the car. If you hold it a few times, there will be some gold powder on your hands and on the car.	yes
希望产品可以改进。	Hope the product can be improved.	yes
这种方形的，也没啥装饰效果，就不要搞金线上去，掉下来在车上弄脏车还麻烦。	This kind of square one doesn't have any decorative effect, so don't use gold lines to remove it; it's still troublesome to fall off the car and stain the car.	yes
东西完好，速度可以，分2个包裹还不同包装	The item is in good condition, the speed is OK, in 2 packages and in different packages	yes
8天的速度蛮快的，但就是2件分了2个包裹，包装还不一样，明显一个防震太多了，厚纸板贴着，封了层塑料，外包装也方便拆，一个就国内的快递盒似的，放了几个缓冲气囊就算事了，感觉有点敷衍。	The speed for 8 days was pretty fast, but the packaging was not the same. Obviously, one was too shockproof. The thick cardboard was attached, sealed with a layer of plastic, and the outer packaging was easy to remove. One was like a domestic courier box; just putting in a few buffer air bags was fine; it felt a bit perfunctory.	yes
雅兰床垫真心不错	The Yalan mattress is really nice	yes
34CM的床垫不是一般的厚，不要床直接睡床垫都可以了。	The 34cm mattress is not usually thick, so you can sleep directly on the mattress without the bed.	yes
质量很好，不管是正面还是背面，都挺软的，睡眠很舒服，躺在上面很快就睡着了。	The quality is very good, it's very soft on both the front and back, very comfortable to sleep, and I fell asleep quickly when lying on it.	yes
床垫收到后因为快递暴力运输有两处有些污渍，雅兰客服很负责，很有效率的联系解决了问题。	After receiving the mattress, there were two stains due to the violent shipping of the courier. The Yalan customer service was very responsible and contacted very efficiently to solve the problem.	yes
并不是自营商品，亚马逊无耻了	It's not a self-operated product; Amazon is shameless	yes
页面明确标注自营，实际上由供应商配送，售后由供应商负责，出问题自行联系供货商。	The page clearly states that it is self-operated. In fact, it is delivered by the supplier. The supplier is responsible for after-sales service. Contact the supplier yourself if there is any problem.	yes
想取消订单，对不起，订单信息已传递给供应商，不能取消；想退换货，在亚马逊成功申请了退换货，对不起，没有人理你，需要自行联系供货商退货。	If you want to cancel the order, I'm sorry, the order information has been sent to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; if you want to return the item, you have successfully applied for a return on Amazon. Sorry, no one cares about you; you need to contact the supplier to return the item yourself.	yes
这尼玛哪门子自营商品。	What kind of product is Nima's own business.	yes
商品不是亚马逊配送，售后亚马逊不承担，客服竟然说“我帮你联系供应商”，还声称就是自营，太无耻了，赤裸裸的不要脸，赤裸裸的对消费者进行欺诈！	The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon is not responsible after the sale. The customer service actually said “I'll help you contact the supplier,” but they also claim that they are self-employed. It's so shameless. It's blatantly shameless, and blatantly defrauded consumers!	yes
郁闷的体验	A depressing experience	yes
之前在别家网购的滤芯，过滤效果不错，28天结束之后再用多一两天也一样没有水垢。	The filter I bought online before from another company had a good filtration effect, and there was no limescale even if I used it for an additional day or two after 28 days.	yes
由于一直以来在亚马逊购置的东西品质都可以，这次就想着在这边买，第一次在亚马逊买滤芯，感觉不太好，不但早早就开始有水垢，而且滤芯一直用到第28天，都会有悬浮的小黑碳粉，真不知道是继续用下去，还是直接扔了好，非常郁闷~	Since everything I've always bought on Amazon is of good quality, this time I wanted to buy a filter on Amazon. The first time I bought a filter on Amazon, I didn't feel very good. Not only did I start to have water stains early on, but the filter will also have suspended little black toner until the 28th day. I really don't know if I'm going to keep using it or just throw it away. I'm very depressing~	yes
没有想象的那么好	It's not as good as I thought	yes
和我以往用过的插线板比较，外部做工一般，内部如何未拆开看，但愿如店家所描述，从使用方便性上看，每一独立单位是否通电缺少显示	Compared to the cable boards I've used in the past, the exterior workmanship is average, and I can see how the interior is not taken apart. Hopefully, as described by the store, from the point of view of ease of use, there is no indication of whether each independent unit is energized	yes
包装破损了，等时间来检验产品的质量。	The packaging is damaged, wait a while to check the quality of the product.	yes
外包装破损较严重，里面的包装盒似乎是新的，但是说明书好像不是新的，九月才装修，囤货中，希望到时候不会是坏的，请亚马逊解释一下为什么好几个顾客提到包装破损，你们却能安然处之，谢谢！	The outer packaging is seriously damaged. The box inside seems to be new, but the instructions don't seem to be new. It was only renovated in September. I'm stocking up. I hope it won't be bad by then. Please Amazon explain why several customers have mentioned that the packaging is damaged, yet you can handle it safely. Thank you!	yes
总体不错，有点小问题	Overall good, a bit of a minor problem	yes
第一次购买滤水壶，看了几篇评价文章，感觉LAICA的性价比高些就选择了这个，收到货按说明书装好了滤芯，试用了一下，感觉总体不错，但是在倒水的时候好像原水会从壶嘴的地方与处理后的水混合（原水仓密封不太严）。	When I bought a water filter bottle for the first time, I read a few reviews of LAICA and chose this one. When I received the product and installed the filter according to the instructions, I tried it. Overall, it felt good, but when I poured water, it seemed like the raw water would mix with the treated water from the spout (the original water tank was not sealed too tightly).	yes
用的时候一定要等所有水过滤完再倒出！	When you use it, be sure to wait until all the water has been filtered before you pour it out!	yes
图片不完整	The picture is incomplete	yes
图片没有拍出侧面的细节，侧面的细节跟主体的风格并不一致，有很大差别，这是其一；这个珠子是泰国产的，没有标明产地，这是其二；没有标明质地，这是其三；我在英国买的时候，分明每项各有盒子，这里只有一个简简单单的塑料袋，而且珠子上面没有任何的产品标志，我哪里判断得出是真是假。	The picture doesn't show the details on the side. The details on the side don't match the style of the main body, and there is a big difference; this is the second; there is no indication of the texture, which is the third; when I bought them in the UK, it was clear that each item had its own box. Here is only a simple plastic bag, and there's no product logo on the beads. How can I tell if it's real or fake.	yes
购买要慎重哦，尤其是买香港出来的东西。	Be careful when buying, especially if you buy things from Hong Kong.	yes
亚马逊客服真烂	Amazon customer service really sucks	yes
两天前下的订单，今天收到就发现降了40块钱，花了好多时间找到客服，客服说没法补差价，可以重买并退货。	The order was placed two days ago, and I found that it had dropped by 40 yuan when I received it today. It took a long time to find customer service. The customer service said they couldn't make up the price difference; they could buy it again and return it.	yes
这种客户体验和服务比某宝某东真是差一万倍。	This kind of customer experience and service is actually ten thousand times worse than Mubao Mudong.	yes
还行，作为新手来说，值得入手	OK, as a newbie, it's worth starting	yes
品相过得去，和极品金刚没得比，之前看过商场那个价格，少说都好几百，我是第一次玩金刚，还行。	It's in excellent condition. It's not comparable to Extreme King Kong. I've seen the prices in shopping malls before, hundreds to say the least. This is my first time playing King Kong, so it's OK.	yes
东西不错	Nice stuff	yes
东西着实不错，送女友的，只是中午我不在加拿快递的时候有些不愉快，物流公司直接放邮件寄存宝里并且没发取件的验证短信给我，害我跑了两趟。	The stuff was really nice. It was delivered to my girlfriend, but I was a little unhappy when I wasn't delivering in Canada at noon. The logistics company sent me an email and sent me a verification text message without receiving it, which caused me to take two trips.	yes
不过宝贝确实不错。	But the baby is really nice.	yes
值得购买	It's worth buying	yes
小猴子可爱，亚马逊优惠力度真大，周生生官网直接发货，前天晚上下单，今天下午就收到了，真快。	The little monkey is cute. The Amazon discount is really strong. It ships directly from Chow Shengsheng's official website. The order was placed the night before yesterday, and I received it this afternoon. It was really fast.	yes
邮政快递员也很负责。	Postal couriers are also very responsible.	yes
赞！	awesome!	yes
一个顾客的告白	A customer's confession	yes
1 收到这样残次品，亚马逊客服告诉你不要急啊，我们54小时左右会跟你联系。	1 When you receive such a defective product, Amazon customer service tells you not to be in a hurry; we will contact you in about 54 hours.	yes
2 然后中间你联系客服人员，他们会告诉你这个问题会有专员处理，他会告知你结果。	2 Then you contact the customer service staff. They will tell you that the issue will be handled by a specialist, and he will let you know the results.	yes
你永远主动联系不上这个专员，也不知道她的工号，也没有直线联系电话，就是你联系不上她，只有她联系你。	You'll never be able to voluntarily contact this specialist, don't know her job number, and don't have a direct contact number; that is, you can't get in touch with her; only she can contact you.	yes
3悲剧的是等了近3天，这个专员联系了我，我手机离开了一会，没有接到这个专员的电话。	3 Tragically, after almost 3 days of waiting, this specialist contacted me, left my phone for a while, and didn't get a call from this specialist.	yes
我等了2个小时也没有等来那个专员的电话，期间我主动联系了亚马逊客服，并邮件发送了客服让她给我回电话。	I waited 2 hours without a call from that specialist. During that time, I took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service and sent an email from customer service asking her to call me back.	yes
4近3天过去了我都还不知道亚马逊对我收到这个残次品的咖啡机，会有什么处理结果！	4 It's been almost 3 days, and I still don't know what the treatment results will be for the Amazon coffee machine that I received as a defective product!	yes
5美国亚马逊的商品没有问题，海外购这种购物方式是好的，但是比对美亚的服务可就差远了。	5 There is no problem with Amazon products in the US. Buying overseas is a good way to shop, but it's far worse than the service in the US and Asia.	yes
6对我来说我只能继续等待...	6 For me I can only keep waiting...	yes
底不平	The bottom is not flat	yes
因为看点评里说的都很好，所有对这款锅很有期待，拿到手的时候也很喜欢，很轻巧，但开锅的时候就发现问题了，锅底不是平的，中间突起来，周边凹下去，油都跑到周边了，特意买来的开锅大肥肉炸出好多油都没法覆盖中央区域，糊了，开锅都开不了，这样的构造估计没法正常煮菜。	Because everything I read in the reviews is very good, I'm looking forward to this pot, and I like it when I get my hands on it. It's very lightweight, but I noticed a problem when I opened the pot. The bottom of the pot was not flat. The center was raised, the periphery was recessed, and the oil had all gone to the periphery. The fat meat I bought on purpose couldn't cover the center area. It's sticky, and I can't even open the pot.	yes
不知道是否我运气不好，刚好拿到个底子不平的锅，幸亏亚马逊提供一个月的退货服务，果断退了。	I don't know if I'm unlucky; I just got a pot with an uneven bottom. Thankfully, Amazon offered a one-month return service, and I decided to return it.	yes
我把锅刷得干干净净地退了，白忙活了半天。	I brushed the pot clean and returned it, and Bai had been busy for half a day.	yes
好的产品设计需要匹配的制造工艺来实现	Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve	yes
这是一款设计风格非常简洁的产品。	This is a product with a very simple design style.	yes
立方体的造型，设计师把顶部处理成微微的弧面。	In the shape of a cube, the designer treated the top as a slightly curved surface.	yes
本来应该是非常流畅的线条。	It was supposed to be a very smooth line.	yes
可惜最终效果没有能够实现。	Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.	yes
因为顶部有两个部件，前面是控制面板，后面水盒顶盖。	Because there are two parts on the top, the control panel on the front and the top cover of the water tank on the back.	yes
顶盖的弧度和控制面板的弧度居然不一致，拼合之后出现了一个最高2mm左右的高差。	The curvature of the top cover was actually inconsistent with the curvature of the control panel. There was a maximum height difference of about 2mm after splicing.	yes
虽然看起来是一个很小的缝隙。	Looks like a pretty small gap though.	yes
但是可以说是把整个设计感都摧毁了。	But it can be said that it destroyed the whole sense of design.	yes
有点心疼那个产品设计师。	I'm a little upset with the product designer.	yes
看来美的的产品经理还没有能力去打造这样的水准的产品。	It seems that Midea's product managers are not yet capable of creating products of this standard.	no
（对于售后小姐的回馈当然不能要求太高，但当我听到售后说道这款产品所有的个体都是这样的，不是只有我买的这件有问题时，她的不以为然和如实重负的情绪让我明白对美的也不能要求太高） 2019-7-7水泵故障出水量少，已经第二次维修，第一次维修后两周又坏了。	(Of course, I can't ask for too much feedback from the after-sales lady, but when I heard the aftersales say that all the individuals on this product were like this, not the only one I bought had a problem, her disbelief and honest burden made me understand that it wasn't too high for beauty.) The 2019-7-7 pump failed with little water output. It had been repaired for the second time, and it was broken two weeks after the first repair.	no
优惠后很划算，亚马逊假优惠很伤心	Very good deal after the discount, Amazon's fake offer is very sad	yes
宝宝出生一周购买，保温超强。	I bought it one week after the baby was born, and it has excellent insulation.	yes
壶的外面摸不到一丝热量，即不怕烫到人也能有效保护温度不外散。	The outside of the pot doesn't touch a hint of heat, so even if you're not afraid of getting burned, it can effectively protect the temperature from scattering.	yes
经过一个晚上空调房依然能保持很高的温度。	After a night, the air conditioning room can still maintain a very high temperature.	yes
亚马逊说周年活动320大优惠，后来发现大家249,289,299都有，瞬间有种被欺骗感，但是去超市对比了一下依然比同价位各种杂牌划算多了，今后外出可随车携带。	Amazon said there were 320 major discounts for the annual event. I later discovered that everyone had 249,289,299. I instantly felt deceived, but after going to the supermarket and comparing them, it was still much cheaper than all kinds of miscellaneous goods at the same price. You can carry them with your car when you go out in the future.	yes
Vitamix 维他美仕6300	Vitamix Vitamix 6300	yes
已观望很久，看到美亚6300打折，中亚海外购同价，赶紧下手。	I've been watching for a long time. Seeing a discount on the Meiya 6300 and Central Asia's overseas purchases at the same price, I quickly started.	yes
9月2号下单，预计到货是21号，结果12号就到了，提前了差不多10天，速度是真快！	The order was placed on September 2. It is expected to arrive on the 21st. As a result, it will arrive on the 12th. It was almost 10 days ahead of schedule. It was really fast!	yes
包装箱不大，直接用的是Vitamix 的原包装，亚马逊也不怕漂洋过海的摔坏了！	The box isn't big; I used Vitamix's original packaging directly, and Amazon isn't afraid it will break when it crosses the ocean!	yes
机器看着挺新，配件齐全，就是杯子放在底座上晃动的厉害，我都害怕开机杯子直接飞出去！	The machine looked brand new and had all the accessories, even though the cup shook so much when placed on the base, I was afraid that the cup would fly out when I started it!	yes
问了一个有5200的朋友，听他描述好像没有我的这个这么松。	I asked a friend who is 5,200 years old and asked him to describe it as if it wasn't as relaxed as mine.	yes
随机附带的食谱全英文，看得挺累，网上也没找到中文版，这是个麻烦事！	The recipes that are randomly attached are all in English. I'm tired of reading them, and I can't find the Chinese version online. This is a problem!	yes
收到货后赶紧的买个了变压器，估计3天能到吧，到时候再好好折腾！	I bought a transformer as soon as I received it. I think it will arrive in 3 days, and I'll have a lot more time to toss around when the time comes!	yes
太小，没伞套，材质一般。	Too small, no umbrella cover, average material.	yes
根本不是大号！	It's not big at all!	yes
第二把Totes，1.这把没有伞套 2.伞柄材质一般 3.明明写Large,实际上就是一人用的便捷雨伞,两个人用估计够呛。	The second pair of Totes, 1. This one doesn't have an umbrella cover 2. The handle material is average 3. Clearly write Large. It's actually a convenient umbrella for one person; it's probably enough for two people.	yes
反而之前在美亚买的那把能三个人用无压力。	Instead, the one I bought in the US before can be used by three people without pressure.	yes
感觉不太好	I don't feel very good	yes
首先是箱子并不怎么结实，用加按一下就变形了，其次是背面设计的平放时防止箱面的ABS刮花并起不了作用，再次是箱子里面就是一块布包着、拉杆的地方凸显出来..等等，各种不满意，最后拉链有点不顺畅。	First, the case isn't very strong; if you press it flat, it doesn't work; secondly, the ABS on the back design doesn't work to prevent the surface of the box from being scratched; the other is that the inside of the case is just a cloth wrapped in a rag that sticks out... etc., I'm not satisfied with all kinds of things, and finally the zipper isn't smooth.	yes
PS：轮子感觉确实挺好的	PS: The wheels feel really good	yes
还可以	It's OK	yes
优点：这款双肩包比较精致，看起来耐用。	Advantages: This backpack is delicate and looks durable.	yes
缺点：卡片上的二维码扫不到（搞什么鬼），15.6寸的笔记本放不下（再长一点点行不行），这款双肩包拉链可以锁起来，却不为买家准备一把锁，不可谓服务至上。	Cons: The QR code on the card can't be scanned (what the hell), I can't put down my 15.6 inch laptop (can't put down a little longer), the zipper of this backpack can be locked, but it doesn't provide a lock for the buyer; service doesn't come first.	yes
整体还行，不认识是否是真皮	The whole thing is OK, I don't know if it's genuine	yes
整体感觉还行，不认识是否是真皮，也就不能瞎评价了。	The overall feeling is OK. I don't know if it's genuine, so I can't evaluate it blindly.	yes
可以装A4幅面的文件，装过80页厚的，但太厚太硬的盒状物体（不能变形的）估计装不下。	It can hold A4 format documents. Over 80 pages thick, but box-shaped objects that are too thick and too hard (cannot be deformed) probably won't fit.	yes
包很软，里面内袋分隔也比较人性化，还是相当不错的。	The bag is very soft, and the inner pocket dividers are quite user-friendly, which is quite nice.	yes
只是我拿到的这个底部有个小砂眼，不知道是我人品不好还是？	It's just that the one I got has a small trachoma on the bottom. I don't know if I'm in bad shape or not?	yes
懒得折腾来回换货，忍了。	Too lazy to go back and forth to exchange goods; bear with it.	yes
整体打个四星，还是值的。	An overall rating of 4 stars is worth it.	yes
ForRoyal 风靡全球 相机背带 单反背带	ForRoyal's most popular camera strap SLR strap	yes
这条背带设计得比较科学，挂双肩，实用，而且胸前是用软材料固定及保护相机，不像其他快枪手那样用螺丝固定底部伤相机，而且取下摄影也很方便。	This strap is scientifically designed; it hangs over two shoulders; it is practical, and the chest is secured and protected with soft material. It doesn't use screws to fix the bottom of the camera like other fast shooters, and it's also easy to take off for photography.	yes
垃圾售后	Garbage after-sales	yes
我一个半月前买的琴，缺个零件，通知亚马逊后给了我售后的电话，多次沟通后，零件现在还没收到，请问这是什么效率！	The piano I bought a month and a half ago was missing a part. After informing Amazon, they gave me an after-sales call. After many conversations, I haven't received the parts yet. Please tell me how efficient this is!	yes
估计之后有问题维修更麻烦，期待好售后的朋友们还是绕道吧，太费心！	I think the repair will be more troublesome if there is a problem later. Hoping that after the sale, friends should take a detour. Too bothersome!	yes
有小缺陷，音色不错	There are minor flaws, the sound is good	yes
琴头有缺陷，少了一个角，感觉是残次品，也没有任何赠品，但是这个价位已经不错了，琴的音色也不错。	The piano head is defective. One horn is missing. It looks like it's a defective product, and there aren't any free gifts, but the price is good, and the sound of the piano is also good.	yes
还行吧，第一把面单	OK, the first batch of noodles	yes
用了很久，除了低音出不来，总体还不错。	I've been using it for a long time, and apart from not being able to get the bass out, overall it's pretty good.	yes
就是做工并没有想象中的那么完美。	However, the workmanship wasn't as perfect as I had imagined.	yes
第一次买的时候，东西有问题，所有的灯在闪烁，无法用。	When I first bought it, there was a problem with the item. All the lights were blinking and I couldn't use it.	yes
要求换货，结果货到上海都三天了，还不送过来。	I asked for a replacement. As a result, it's been three days since it arrived in Shanghai, and it hasn't been delivered yet.	yes

标签粘性太差，不防水	The label has poor adhesiveness and is not waterproof	yes
虽然蓝牙连接很方便，但是打印出来的内容不防水，而且表面没有覆膜；且标签粘性很差，用于线缆标签根本不行，非常容易掉下来，买来用于整理线缆的朋友需要注意一下了。	Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not coated; moreover, the adhesive of the label is very poor, so it doesn't work at all for cable labels; it falls off very easily. If you buy it to organize cables, you should pay attention.	yes
笔还可以，不过包裹太简陋了，就一个纸盒子，什么保护措施都没有，而且装笔的盒子用一大块透明胶粘着，撕下来胶都在盒子上。	The pen is OK, but the package is too simple. It's just a paper box; there are no protective measures, and the box that holds the pen is attached with a large piece of transparent glue, so if you remove the glue, it's all on the box.	yes
六百元的东西就这样对待，很失望的一次购物。	The 600 yuan item was treated like this. It was a very disappointing shopping trip.	yes

先赞一下天天快递吧，航空件，超迅速，服务态度也很好！	First, let's praise Tiantian Express. The airfares are super fast and the service is very good!	yes
一直在用925-25,非常棒，刚收到925-85，笔的质量没的说，样式也非常漂亮，之所以给四星是因为笔有点重，不适合快速写字，笔帽调节铅芯长度处有点晃动，个人意见：925-25要比85更顺手。	I've been using the 925-25. It's great. I just received the 925-85. Not to mention the quality of the pen, the style is also very beautiful. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the pen is a bit heavy and not suitable for fast writing. The cap shakes a bit when adjusting the length of the lead core. My personal opinion: 925-25 is easier than 85.	yes
因此变成亚马逊死忠粉	As a result, I became an Amazon die-hard fan	yes
超级优惠的价格买的，结果孩子不喜欢点读笔。	I bought it at a super bargain price. As a result, kids don't like reading pens.	yes

我两年前在某易购买过一个蓝色的，音质还不错没有杂音低音也不错，用了两年多用坏了打算再买一个（urbeats ），毕竟感觉还不错。	I bought a blue one from Someyi two years ago. The sound quality is pretty good, there's no noise or bass, and I'm planning to buy another one (urbeats) after using it for over 2 years. After all, it feels pretty good.	yes
又看了出了个紫色的挺好看的，结果买来这个今天打开一听才感觉不对劲，一边声音大一边声音小。	I also saw a pretty purple one. As a result, I bought this one today and only heard it didn't feel right. While it was loud, it was quiet.	yes
开始我以为是那首歌音效的缘故没有多想，可后来听了半天我才发现这个问题很严重，不光偏音，低音效果也没我之前那个听起来好了，还有些许杂音，是只有我买的这个紫色的有这个现象吗？还是现在耳机制造工艺确实不行了呢?	At first I thought it was because of the sound effects of that song, but after listening to it for half a day, I discovered that the problem was serious. Not only was the sound polarized, the bass effect didn't sound as good as I had before. There was also a bit of noise. Is it only the purple one I bought that has this phenomenon? Or is the current headphone manufacturing process really not working?	yes

2.后板音频输入插口，喇叭输出端子都好差，随便找台1000-2000的CD功放一体机要比这款好太多了。	2. The audio input jack and speaker output terminals on the back panel are all very poor. Just looking for a 1000-2000 all-in-one CD amplifier is much better than this one.	yes
3.顶盖比较薄，我的变压器那边还凹下去了，不得已开箱用手恢复，顶盖和前面板结合松动。	3. The top cover is relatively thin, and the side of my transformer is still dented. As a last resort, I opened the box and restored it with my hands. The top cover and front panel came loose.	yes
4.整个机器重心偏向变压器端，搬动的时候很别扭。	4. The center of gravity of the whole machine is deflected to the transformer end, which is very awkward when moving.	yes

感觉索尼要放在中国代工要比小马好多了。	I feel like Sony's OEM in China would be much better than the pony.	yes
5.机器发热大，看场电影用的两声道2个小时左右顶盖用手摸一下得有40-50℃，不知道是不是变压器太大发热量大。	5. The machine heats up a lot. The two channels used to watch the movie are 40-50℃ when you touch the top cover with your hands. I don't know if the transformer is too big and generates a lot of heat.	yes
现在多用开关电源，这个傻大的变压器估计得有4KG。	Now that we use a lot of switching power supplies, this stupid transformer is estimated to be 4 kg.	no
索尼应该在机器里面用主动散热的静音风扇，开箱后只看到管子上大型铝板散热片。	Sony should use a silent fan with active cooling in the machine. After unpacking, you can only see the large aluminum heatsink on the tube.	no
小贵	Expensive	yes

很想解剖一下，看看它肚子里到底是什么。	I'd love to have an autopsy to see what it really is in its stomach.	yes
后来想想，万一拆开后很失望，花那么多钱就太冤了；万一拆开后很满意，再装起来就难了，用着就不爽了。	When I think about it later, if you are very disappointed after unpacking it, it would be a mistake to spend that much money; if you are satisfied after unpacking it, it will be difficult to put it back on, and it won't be nice to use it.	yes

我惊愕了，音质竟然是环绕3D立体！	I was stunned; the sound quality was 3D surround!	yes
我在实体通讯店问过了，差不多的30左右，但绝不是品胜牌子的，是杂牌的，因此说这款品胜虽然27块，但是性价比绝对的值得拥有！	I asked about it at a physical communication store. It's about 30, but it's definitely not Pinsheng's brand; it's miscellaneous, so even though this Pinsheng is 27 yuan, it's definitely worth owning for money!	yes
最差的网购体验	The worst online shopping experience	yes

查询亚马逊订单状态，卖家没有提供快递单号，查不到订单在哪儿。	Check the status of the Amazon order. The seller did not provide a tracking number, so I can't find out where the order is.	yes
于是发邮件给卖家问是否能提供快递单号，过了两天一直没有回复。	So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide a tracking number, but there was no response after 2 days.	yes
无奈之下，打亚马逊客服，客服告诉了卖家的手机号码，我再打电话问店家，打了几次之后，电话通了，被告知快递丢件了，可以立刻再重新发我一个。	In desperation, I called Amazon customer service.

As a result, I checked the logistics in the evening without receiving any phone calls or text messages, but it was actually signed for at noon. It also showed that I signed for it!	yes

货还不错	The goods are pretty good	yes
首先说一句刚买了几天就发现降价了，差评，本还算不错，性价比高，cpu和显卡足够应付主流网游和相当一部分大型单机了，散热非常好，但屏幕有点漏光(ips屏的通病)，音响质量不太好，硬盘不好(建议自己花点钱加个固态)，昨天拿去售后检测了一下硬件，没有任何问题，自带的win8.1不太好用，建议升级成10，卖家发货很快，各项询问回答的也很快，收到电脑第二天发票就到了，不错，可惜什么赠品都没有。	First of all, I found a price drop just a few days after I bought it. The review is pretty good. It's cost-effective. The CPU and video card are good enough for mainstream online games and quite a few large stand-alone computers. The cooling is very good, but the screen is a bit leaking (common problem with IPS screens), the sound quality is not good, and the hard drive isn't good (I recommend spending some money to add a solid state). I took it yesterday and tested the hardware after the sale. There are no problems. The win8.1 that comes with it is not easy to use. I recommend upgrading to 10. The seller shipped it very fast. The questions were answered very quickly. The invoice arrived the day after I got it on the computer. Nice, but unfortunately it's a free gift None at all.	yes
(顺便提一句买键盘贴膜一定不要去某宝一家叫E酷数码中心的店买，发货慢质量差，产品有问题不退不换，老板还满嘴脏话，特别曝光一下)	(By the way, don't go to a certain Bao store called E-Ku Digital Center to buy keyboard stickers. Delivery is slow and the quality is poor, there are no returns or exchanges if there are any problems with the product, and the boss is still full of foul language. Please make a special revelation)	yes
东西很好，平台官僚依旧	The stuff is very good, the platform bureaucracy is still the same	yes
硬盘质量非常好，性价比绝对高，比香港买还便宜，不急着用和可以忍受物流的话绝对推荐购买。	The hard drive is of very good quality, and is definitely cost-effective. It's cheaper than buying it in Hong Kong. If you're not in a hurry or can endure the logistics, I definitely recommend buying it.	yes
但不得不说的是亚马逊平台之官僚依旧，与几年前我发誓绝对不用的时候没有改进，你永远查不到实际物流状况，信息永远是几个星期以后送到，永远不能投诉，就是这么官僚！	But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same. There were no improvements when I swore a few years ago that I would never use it. You'll never be able to check the actual logistics situation, the information will always arrive a few weeks later, and you can never file a complaint. That's just the bureaucracy!	yes
货收到几天了，物流信息还是10几天后你将会收到货！	It's been a few days since you received the item, and the logistics information is still about 10 days before you receive it!	yes
物流不省心	Unworry-free logistics	yes
送来成这个样子，不仅包装压扁，电器包装也是开的，也不知道有没有调包。	It came out looking like this. Not only was the package flattened, but the electrical appliance package was also opened, and I don't know if the package had been adjusted.	yes
FYI	FYI	yes
还没有试用，一贯信赖飞利浦，希望电池寿命比其它牌子要长一些。	I haven't tried it yet. I've always trusted Philips, and I hope the battery lasts longer than other brands.	yes
上网查了，可能是进水的通病，而且没有保修。	I checked it on the internet. It's probably a common problem with water ingress, and there's no warranty.	yes
郁闷！	Depressed!	yes
现在裹上保鲜膜继续用，不知能用多久？	Now wrap it in plastic wrap and keep using it. I don't know how long it will last?	yes
买到别人拆开过的	Bought one that someone else has taken apart	yes
三百多的机器要一百多的税确实比较高，看现在再六百多心里平衡多了。	The tax on more than 300 machines that cost more than 100 is actually quite high. It seems that now more than 600 machines have a much more balanced mind.	yes
收到的时候封口胶条状态看着就很不对，像是拆开过，赶紧先拍了照，果然一撕就开了，打开后里面的纸板还有损坏，担心是别人退的，还没到纪念日就赶紧先给老公试试了，结果机器一点电都没有，还好刀头里面没有胡渣，要不大老远的咋退啊！	When I received it, the sealing tape looked very wrong. It looked like it had been unpacked. I quickly took a picture. Sure enough, it opened as soon as I tore it. The cardboard inside was still damaged after opening. I was worried that someone else had returned it. I quickly tried it on my husband before the anniversary. As a result, the machine had no electricity at all. Fortunately, there was no scum on the knife head. How can I go back if it's not too old!	yes
好不好用或者短期会不会有什么问题还未知，如前面的评价，缺货时发出的东西确实不靠谱！	Whether it's easy to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term is still unknown. As in the previous review, what they send when they are out of stock is really unreliable!	yes
体验感中偏上水平	Higher level of experience	yes
差不多顶级电动了，有很多种洁牙模式，但是很少人会天天换不同模式刷吧。	It's almost top-level electric. There are many modes for cleaning teeth, but few people switch between different modes of brushing every day.	yes
用了半年没有啥问题，每天刷，差不多1个多星期一冲。	I haven't had any problems after using it for half a year. I brush it every day, and I wash it almost every Monday.	yes
刷头配件在亚马逊买同样便宜。	Brush accessories are just as cheap to buy on Amazon.	yes
App有点难用，除了改一下颜色那些，其他貌似兼容的问题是海外版的原因？	The app is a bit difficult to use. Other than changing the colors, are there any other compatibility issues that seem to be the reason for the overseas version?	yes
希望学学大法的。	Those who want to learn Dafa.	yes
性价比很高	Very cost-effective	yes
已经使用了3-4次了。	Have used it 3-4 times.	yes
1、包装完好。	1. The packaging is intact.	yes
2、使用非常简单，清洗也很方便。	2. Very easy to use and easy to clean.	yes
3、完全可以DIY理发，省钱了。	3. It's completely possible to DIY haircuts, saving money.	yes
综上，非常成功的一次购买。	All in all, a very successful purchase.	yes
有假货	There are fakes	yes
上次买了两包，居然是两种不同的版本，本来包装上左下角的字是绿色的，结果有一包就不是，是白色的字，结果猫猫吃了就拉肚子了。	The last time I bought two packs, they are actually two different versions. Originally, the letters in the lower left corner of the package were green, but it turned out that it wasn't; it was white; as a result, cats had diarrhea when they ate them.	yes
是亚马逊的货源是假的，还是发货时被员工掉包，我确定不了。	I'm not sure if the Amazon supply is fake or if the package was dropped by an employee at the time of delivery.	yes
我会再买一次，如果还是假货，我就要找你们相关人士追责了。	I'll buy it again; if it's still a fake, I'll have to go to your relevant people to account.	yes
是横杠的！	It's a horizontal bar!	yes
亚马逊图片上是斜杠的，结果给我发来是横杠的，这不是骗人吗?	The Amazon image has slashes, but the results sent me are horizontal bars. Isn't that a lie?	yes
效果还行	The effect is OK	yes
猫猫喜欢吃，这是重点。	Cats love to eat, that's the point.	yes
也确实有效果。	It's also really effective.	yes
紧、窄，箍脚、磨脚背。	Tight, narrow, hoop the foot, polish the back of the foot.	yes
不推荐。	NOT RECOMMENDED.	yes
1.UN是clarks最舒服的系列，可惜这款太差了。	1.un is Clarks's most comfortable series, but unfortunately this one is so bad.	yes
追加：今天对比了以前的UN系列鞋垫（鞋扔了垫留着用），材质比以前差了不少，弹性不如以前，透气也不如以前，就是假假的软。	Added: Today I compared the previous UN series insoles (leave the padding on the shoes). The material is much worse than before. They are not as elastic as before, and they are not as breathable as before, but they are fake and soft.	yes
2.我的脚背不算高，硌的部位在脚背最高处向前3公分左右。	2. The back of my foot isn't that tall. The buttuckles are about 3 cm forward from the highest point on the back of the foot.	yes
3.海外购买了三双clarks，只有一双合适。	3. I bought three pairs of Clarks overseas; only one pair is suitable.	yes
吓得我把收藏夹里的其乐都删了。	I was so scared that I deleted all the music from my wishlist.	yes
回头试试rockport，不行只能去ecco实体店了。	Go back and try Rockport. If not, you can only go to the ECCO physical store.	yes
以次充好，品控不好	Secondary charging is good, quality control is not good	yes
首先，值得肯定的是Prime海外购Ups很给力，31号下的单6号就收到了。	First of all, what is worth affirming is that Prime is very effective in buying Ups overseas. The order placed on the 31st was received on the 6th.	yes
鞋子颜色比图片好看很多，皮质感觉不错。	The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.	yes
鞋码稍大一点点，25脚长10.5宽拍的7.5W，上脚稍微有点宽松，不过平时就喜欢穿宽松一点，垫一双鞋垫刚好。	The shoe size is slightly larger. The 25 feet are 10.5 wide at 7.5W. The upper foot is slightly loose, but I usually like to wear looser ones; a pair of insoles is just right.	yes
其次，这个鞋子品控真的不敢恭维，一只鞋底胶有破损，另外一只鞋面有各种擦痕还有个针眼，鞋面与鞋底连接处胶条错位，明摆着的以次充好！	Second, the quality control of this shoe is really unflattering. The sole of one shoe is damaged, the other has various scratches and a needle eye. The rubber strip at the connection between the upper and the sole is misplaced, and the clearly marked one can be refilled again!	yes
有点后悔！	I regret it a bit!	yes
做活动280块买到的，这个价格买到亚瑟士相当划算，当然看评论还有更低的价格。	I bought it for 280 yuan to do activities. It's quite a bargain to buy an Asics at this price. Of course, there are lower prices based on reviews.	yes
现在说一下鞋子，优点：鞋子很轻，跑步挺舒服，也比较合脚，不会松松垮垮的。	Now let's talk about shoes. Advantages: They are very light, very comfortable to run, fit quite well, and don't come loose.	yes
颜值很高但缺点也很明显：我一般穿40的鞋，这次买的40.5的，穿进去鞋子前端大概还有1个大拇指的距离，但是，这并不影响什么。	They look great, but the drawbacks are obvious: I usually wear 40's shoes, and the 40.5 ones I bought this time are about 1 thumb away from the front end of the shoes, but this doesn't affect anything.	yes
这鞋很“窄”，虽然前面还留着距离，但是感觉紧紧的。	These shoes are very “narrow,” and although there is still distance between the front, they feel tight.	yes
还有一点，鞋子透气可能不太好，现在穿感觉脚很热。	Also, the shoes may not be very breathable, and I feel that my feet are very hot when I wear them.	yes
压脚背	Press the back of the foot	yes
首先鞋子做工很好，值这个价。	First of all, the shoes are very well made and worth the price.	yes
我的脚是很标准那种，跑鞋uk7.5,eu41.5,皮鞋uk6.5,亚马逊的爱步也买过几双，从来没有出现过不合脚，但是这双我参照评论，买大一号uk7,上脚后因为大了一码长度明显偏长，但因为鞋垫太厚，还是压脚背压的厉害，加上徒步鞋非常硬，导致上脚非常难受。	My feet are very standard. I've bought a few pairs of running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, and Amazon's Aibou, and I've never seen them fit, but I read the reviews. I bought one size larger uk7. After the upper foot was one size larger, they were clearly too long, but because the insole was too thick, they still put a lot of pressure on the back of the foot. In addition, the hiking shoes are very hard, making the upper foot very uncomfortable.	yes
如果你的脚不是特别瘦那种，不推荐购买这款。	If you don't have particularly thin feet, I don't recommend buying this one.	yes
如果一定要买，换个鞋垫也能解决，但是原配鞋垫看起来很高级的样子，不用又可惜。	If you have to buy it, changing the insole will solve it, but the original insole looks very classy, so it's a pity not to use it.	yes
非常完美的一次购物！	A perfect shopping trip!	yes

春天要用的时候发现和手环怎么也连不上，两个设备说明书都表示支持对方，后来发现应该是心率带的问题，因为找来其它的设备还是连不上。	When I needed to use it in the spring, I discovered that it couldn't connect to the bracelet. Both device manuals indicated support for each other, but I later discovered that it was probably a heart rate band problem because I still couldn't connect to other devices.	yes

你好歹告诉一声，到底是好的还是坏的啊！	Just tell me, is it a good thing or a bad one!	yes
打电话去问，说这样寄回来表示设备没问题，是好的。	Call and ask and say that sending it back like this means there is no problem with the device. That's fine.	no

尺码 物流	Size logistics	yes
做工还可以，就是物流太慢了，以前的鞋子什么都是DHL，这次Apex真是...国内买过很多UA，价格都不低，感觉搞的比NIKE ADIDAS档次高？	The workmanship is OK, but the logistics are too slow. All of the shoes used to be DHL, but this time Apex is really... I've bought a lot of UA domestically, and the price isn't low. I think the one made is higher grade than NIKE ADIDAS?	yes
其实都一样好吧，所以海淘。	Actually, they're all just as good, so sea bream.	yes

The M I bought had a slightly long hem. The others are perfect to wear. I think I recommend a size S. Are you that slim? Still prefer a tight fit? I think a looser hoodie would be better.	yes
大小正好	Just the right size	yes
胸围99，身高184，体重84公斤，购买前咨询了客服被告知应该买xxl的，然后看了评论果断入手L的，收货后发现大小正好，差点就被坑了。	I had a bust circumference of 99, a height of 184, and a weight of 84 kg. Before purchasing, I consulted customer service and was told that I should buy the XXL one, then I read the reviews and decided to buy the L one. After receiving the item, I discovered that the size was just right, so I almost got hit.	yes

玩具加工质量不好	The processing quality of toys is not good	yes
螺栓孔大部分都没对齐，上螺栓很费劲，可见加工质量不好，也不知道可以玩多长时间，因為是给孩子许诺的东西，也就不退了。	Most of the bolt holes aren't aligned. It's very hard to get the bolt on. You can see that the processing quality is not good, and I don't know how long I can play, because it's something I promised my kids, so it won't go back.	yes
其他评论中说安装不费劲的，难道只有我买的这一件存在问题？	Other reviews say it's not a hassle to install; is this the only one I bought that has a problem?	yes
很一般	Very average	yes
难道是我运气不好？	Am I unlucky?	yes
包装旧到不行；做工很一般；音乐只有一种而且只有8秒长度然后不断重复；动作就是摇脑袋径自往前走，没任何变化。	The packaging is too old to work; the workmanship is average; there is only one type of music and is only 8 seconds long and then repeated over and over; the movement is just shaking the head and moving forward, no change.	yes
不值这个价。	Not worth the price.	yes
急用，就不退货了。	If you use it urgently, you won't return it.	yes
玩具质量不错，吐槽一下包装	The toy is of good quality, I'm going to complain about the packaging	yes
昨天收到快递，亚马逊买的，标注的是EMS运送，最后是天猫的快递送过来的，这是转了多少个弯？亚马逊和天猫关系还不错？	I received the courier yesterday. I bought it on Amazon. The one marked EMS delivery was, and finally the one delivered by Tmall. How many turns did this take? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall pretty good?	yes
再说一下包装，就是用保鲜膜包了几层，里面连个包装塑料泡泡纸都没有，打开一看，所有的零件就放在空荡荡的盒子里，还好玩具质量不错，没有坏掉的零件，就是比想象中的小太多了，因为不是带电池的，手推着经常脱轨，感觉轨道两边空隙太大，设计不合理。	Also, speaking of the packaging, there are a few layers of plastic wrap. There isn't even a plastic bubble paper inside. Once you open it, all the parts are in an empty box. Fortunately, the toy is of good quality. There are no broken parts, but it's too small than I had imagined. Because it doesn't come with a battery, it often derails when pushed by hand. It feels like the gap on both sides of the track is too large and the design is unreasonable.	yes
质量好，好玩	Good quality, fun	yes
很好玩，组件精度很高，做工精致，质量跟乐高差不多了，做活动时价格十分优惠。	Very fun, the components are very accurate, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is about the same as LEGO, and the price is very reasonable when doing activities.	yes

The quick numbers on the first one were not fully displayed; the time for the six yuan was not consistent; the difference ranged from about ten hours.	yes
我联系厂家问手表在入库有核对时间吗?他们回复说“有”，既然有，那为啥时间相差那么多，那肯定是手表没有精确度，简单地说就是水货产品，不是我说的难听，看嘛，很明显的质量问题（数字显示不完全）都拿出来卖，是不是垃圾货。	I contacted the manufacturer to ask if there is a check time for the watch when it is in storage? They replied “Yes,” so why is there such a time difference? That must be because the watch doesn't have accuracy. Simply put, it's an aquatic product. It's not that I'm saying it's hard to hear. Look, they all have obvious quality issues (numbers are not fully displayed) and sold. Are they junk?	yes
我联系卖家，卖家说了一大堆的理由，还埋怨当初不应该买他们的东西，这样的产品，这样的卖家，这样的售后服务，以后谁还敢在亚马逊上买东西。	I contacted the seller, who gave a bunch of reasons and complained about things they shouldn't have bought in the first place, products like this, sellers like this, and after-sales service like this, who would dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future.	yes
总之我建议不要跟此卖家买东西，买了也是垃圾东西。	Anyway, I recommend not buying anything from this seller; buying it is also junk.	yes
亚马逊发货问题	Amazon shipping issues	yes
收到货后检查发现：	After receiving the goods, the inspection revealed:	yes
1、表包装严重破旧。	1. The watch packaging is seriously dilapidated.	yes
2、表说明书有严重使用褶皱。	2. The manual on the watch has serious usage wrinkles.	yes
3、表不走，台灯充电也无发使用，无法调整时间。	3. The watch does not go away, the desk lamp does not charge and is unusable, and the time cannot be adjusted.	yes
4、分别联系亚马逊客服，只能自费邮寄至美国，后补邮费。	4. Contact Amazon customer service separately. You can only mail to the US at your own expense, and pay for postage later.	yes
5、2分的原因是客服服务还不错。	The reason for 5 or 2 points is that the customer service is pretty good.	yes
只能说还凑合	I can only say that it fits	yes
时间不是非常准，每天约快一秒，用了才几个月已经快两分多了。	The time isn't very accurate. It's about one second faster every day; it's been over two minutes after only a few months of use.	yes
以前用过一块西铁城的，感觉一两年也不会差几秒。	I've used a piece of Nishitetsu City before, and I feel like it won't be a few seconds away in a year or two.	yes
万年历功能倒是蛮不错，计时功能有点鸡肋，基本用不到，偶尔会误触进入计时模式。	The perpetual calendar function is pretty good. The timing function is a bit lacking. Basically, I can't use it. Occasionally, I mistakenly touch it to enter the timing mode.	yes
太阳能运动手表	solar sports watch	yes
优点：太阳能充电不用担心须更换电池、具备世界时间、多种闹铃及整点提醒。	Advantages: Solar charging doesn't have to worry about changing batteries, has world time, multiple alarms, and full reminders.	yes
不足：镜面容易划伤、进灰尘。	Disadvantage: The mirror surface is easily scratched and dusty.	yes
性价比：国内一般价格在220-300之间，海外购到手180多（用时1周左右）。	Cost-effective ratio: The average domestic price is between 220-300, and more than 180 are purchased overseas (it takes about 1 week).	yes
很满意的手表	Very satisfied with the watch	yes
肯定是正品，去专柜验过货，表的外观很漂亮，做工精细，用料足，加上又是进口机械机芯，所以是有一定的分量的，是那些三四百所谓的机械表不能比的，这个是货真价实的。	It must be a genuine product. I went to the counter to inspect the product. The watch looks very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the materials are sufficient, and it also has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It is unmatched by those 3,400 so-called mechanical watches. This is a genuine product.	yes
表的走时是很准的，误差完全在可接受范围内，表的包装里有珠宝鉴定证书，表盘的12字那里是真钻石，这个自己戴很合适，作为礼品送出去也很有面子。	The watch's timing is very accurate, and the error is within an acceptable range. There is a jewelry certification in the package of the watch. The 12 characters on the dial are real diamonds. It's perfect to wear on yourself, and it also looks great when you send it out as a gift.	yes
宾利表确实不错。	Bentley watches are really nice.	yes
有史以来体验最差的一次购物	The worst shopping experience ever	yes
9月23日晚上老婆手机摔了，心血来潮立马来亚马逊订购了一台8p，有货但是不是自营的且没有加价（心里暗喜），由于不是自营的发货比较慢，系统显示预计最晚收货要到9月27日。	My wife's phone fell on the night of September 23. Out of her heart, she ordered an 8p one from Amazon. It was in stock but it wasn't self-operated and there was no price increase (I'm happy). Since it's not self-operated, the system says it is expected to arrive until September 27 at the latest.	yes
老婆没手机用难受死了，第二天一早6点多叫我在想想办法，后来上京东一看256G有货可以当天送到，只得立马再订购一台。	My wife was so upset that she didn't have a cell phone. At 6:00 a.m. the next morning, she told me to think of a solution. Later, when I went to JD to see that the 256G was in stock and that it could be delivered the same day, I had to order another one right away.	yes
新的买好了，就想着马上把亚马逊的订单给取消。	I made a new purchase and wanted to cancel my Amazon order right away.	yes
由于订单是半夜下的，没可能凌晨来收快递，7点多打给客服要求取消订单，客服答复已经取消请等待短信通知。	Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it is impossible to receive the delivery early in the morning. Call customer service after 7 o'clock to cancel the order. The customer service replied that it had already been cancelled, please wait for an SMS notification.	yes
好吧，我就耐心的等着，到了中午上手机一看，订单还在状态还处于未发货，就立马联系客服要求赶快取消订单，客服答复已经操作OK。	OK, I just waited patiently. At noon, I took a look on my phone. The order was still in status and still unshipped, so I immediately contacted customer service to request a quick cancellation. The customer service replied that the operation was OK.	yes
到了下午3点上手机一看订单还在，没办法只能再次联系客服明确告知已经第三次来电了，请取消订单并通知卖家务必不要发货！	When I checked the order on my phone at 3 p.m., I had no choice but to contact customer service again to clearly let them know that it had already been called for the third time. Please cancel the order and tell the seller not to ship it!	yes
客服在我要求下当场联系了卖家，并告知我卖家不熟悉系统，要等熟悉系统后再操作取消订单。	The customer service contacted the seller on the spot at my request and told me that the seller was not familiar with the system and that they had to wait until they were familiar with the system before canceling the order.	yes
但是明确告诉我卖家已经知道了，绝对不会发货的请放心。	But don't worry if you tell me clearly that the seller already knows and will never ship it.	yes
等到周一我再看订单显示，竟然已经发货了，我也是无语了。	I waited until Monday to read the order and it turned out that it had already been shipped, and I was speechless.	yes
由于无法直接联系卖家，只能再次致电客服。	Since it is not possible to contact the seller directly, it is only possible to call customer service again.	no
后面的处理简直无语，基本都是我说一步，客服才接着操作一下。	The rest of the processing was just speechless. Basically, I said one step before the customer service moved on.	no
订单到目前为止还是处于派件拒收状态，正准备再次派送！	The order has so far been declined for delivery and is preparing to be delivered again!	no
亚马逊难道不会主动跟进下吗？	Wouldn't Amazon take the initiative to follow up?	no
卖家公司反正也收了钱不跟进也无所谓了。	It doesn't matter if the seller company takes the money anyway and doesn't follow up.	no
总结下以后大件绝对不会预付钱了，这个样子太麻烦了。	To sum it up, I'll never pay for big items in advance; this is so bothersome.	no
看起来很美好	It looks beautiful	yes
很久以前就看中这个摄像头了，但是因为除了价格外，还有一些别的原因，所以没有购买，这次因为凑包邮，价格也还可以所以就买了。	I liked this camera a long time ago, but I didn't buy it because there were other reasons other than the price. This time I bought it because of the free shipping and the price is OK.	yes
买来之后其他的都没什么问题，就是在软件连接的时候，怎么都连不上，我家是TP的路由器，上网查了之后发现好多人都有这个问题，弄了两个多小时，各种改路由器的设置，最后我用360WIFI作为媒介给弄好的，期间给小米客服打电话，他们对这个问题也没有什么解决方法，直接就让我联系亚马逊进行售后。	After I bought it, there was no problem with anything else. Even when the software connected, I couldn't connect to it. My family is a TP router. After searching the internet, I found that many people have this problem. It took more than two hours to change the router settings. Finally, I used 360 WIFI as a medium to get it done. I called Xiaomi customer service during the period. They had no solution to this problem, so I just asked me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.	yes
另外一点值得注意的就是我在网上看到用户的评论说，这个摄像头支持的存储卡最小是8G，存储容量更小的就不能识别，希望大家注意这点。	Another thing worth noting is that I read comments from users on the internet saying that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, so I can't recognize it if the storage capacity is smaller. I hope everyone will pay attention to this.	yes
用起来感觉还可以吧，画面还可以接受，但声音音质很差，机器有一定程度的发热，一直开启的话，感觉这种程度的发热有点让人难以接受。	It feels OK to use. The picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor. The machine heats up to a certain extent. If you keep it on, I feel that this level of heat is a bit difficult for people to accept.	yes
综上所述，本产品还有诸多不足，希望大家买的时候要慎重。	In summary, there are still many shortcomings in this product, so I hope everyone should be careful when buying it.	yes
之所以给3星，是因为这个是和人生的初恋买的，交往了快3年，就这样于去年离我而去了，一直到现在。	The reason I gave it 3 stars is because I bought it for the first love of my life. I've been in a relationship for almost 3 years, and left me like this last year until now.	yes
之所以给3星，是因为这个是和人生的初恋买的，现在不知道用到什么程度了，或许扔掉了吧！	The reason I gave it 3 stars is because I bought it for my first love in life. Now I don't know how much I've used it; I probably threw it away!	yes

As soon as I think of her, I want to leave this world with heartache. The first woman in my life brought me shadows and heartache for the rest of my life, and I haven't been able to walk out yet.	yes
买这个手机的时候，想想两个当时感觉，还是能一起同甘共苦，但现在却是不堪回首，人生或许就是这样吧，有些人一辈子都不想遇到，有些事儿一辈子都不想知道，可是有什么办法呢？	When I bought this phone, I think about how the two of them felt at the time and were still able to share the same hardships together, but now I can't look back. Maybe life is like this. Some people don't want to experience it for the rest of their lives, and some things they don't want to know for the rest of their lives, but what are some ways?	yes
多少次一看到三星这个手机，脑海就想起她，那种痛苦就随之而来灌满全身，我从没舍得用过超过2千元的手机，可是买给她的时候，却毫不犹豫，对一个人再好，可是有天当她变心了，所有的山盟海誓也就烟消云散了。	As many times as I saw this Samsung phone, I thought of her. That kind of pain filled my whole body. I never bothered to use a phone that cost more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate to be nice to one person, but one day when she changed her mind, all the Mountain League vows would dissipate.	yes
国产品牌中的精品	The best products from domestic brands	yes

没有实力的企业根本不可能做到这样，也不敢这么做！	It's impossible for a company without power to do this, and they don't dare to do it!	yes
正是源于此，我才选择了华为。	It is for this reason that I chose Huawei.	yes
买来用了半年多了，感觉一直很好，非常不错。	I bought it and used it for over half a year, and it always feels great, very nice.	yes
之所以没有给满分，是因为有一次在用它的离线导航时，出现了不定位现象，我最终没有找出原因，其他时候都很好。	The reason I didn't give it a perfect score was because there was one time when I was using it to navigate offline, and I didn't find out the reason in the end; other times it was fine.	yes
而且它的在线输入好了目的地，搜索之后自动设计出路线，离开wifi出发以后，它自动离线导航的功能很实用，不用跑流量，它直接跟卫星对话来实现定位及导航，非常好！	Moreover, it enters the destination online, and automatically designs the route after searching. After leaving WiFi, its automatic offline navigation function is very practical. It doesn't need to run traffic; it directly talks to the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, which is great!	yes
索尼大法好	Sony Dafa is good	yes
索尼的这种低端机，设计感依旧十足，而且价格便宜，屏幕够大，续航力一级棒，给老人使用很合适。	This low-end Sony model still has a great sense of design, and is cheap. The screen is big enough, and the battery life is excellent, making it very suitable for the elderly to use.	yes
虽然时间已经过去很久了，但这机器依旧没什么毛病。	Although it's been a long time, there's still nothing wrong with this machine.	yes
不过因为我的Z2下放了，所以这台手机也完成了使命。	But since my Z2 was decentralized, this phone also completed its mission.	yes

了的目标文件.	The target file is up.	yes
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	After compilation, it stops, and no assembly is performed.	yes
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	Use pipes instead of temporary files to work between different stages of the compilation process, because the assembler of those systems cannot read data from pipes. GNU's assembler does not have this problem. The assembler can accept C "dialects": supports ANSI-compliant C programs.	yes
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This closes some ANSICc-incompatible feature keywords in GNUCc, as well as ANSItrigraph features such as unix and vax that indicate that they are welcome and rarely used, and disables all standard libraries that are available in the host environment ( hosted environment) . The main function returns an int value, a typical example of which is almost all programs except the kernel.

The most obvious example is the operating system kernel in the operating system kernel. For details, please refer to the latest information on the gcc website) .	yes
对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	Function declarations with no parameters, such as `intfoo(); ', are handled in C style - that is, they do not specify the number or type of parameters. ( Only for C++)	no
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	Normally, such a function foo means that the argument is empty in C++.	no
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	The section list is deleted from here to try to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.	no
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	See the NUc manual for details, we have removed the details so that when the content is out of date, people will not HERI when the content is out of date.	no
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	Except for one thing: For C++ programs ( not C), the `-traditional' option has the additional effect of allowing assignment to this value.	no
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	It has the same effect as the '-Ethis-is-variable' option.	no
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of traditional Cc preprocessors.	no
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	In particular, what is mentioned above about the preprocessor, but does not include other effects of the '-traditional' option.	no
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	-fdollars-in-identifiers Allow `$' characters in identifiers ( C++ only)	no
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	You can specify the `"-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly disable the `$' character.	no
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	( GNUC++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not all systems.) )	no
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of ant types to enumeration types ( MEFc++) .	no
正常情况下 GNU C++ 允许从 enum 到 int 的转换,反之则不行.	Normally GNUC++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.	no
-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	-fexternal--templates generates smaller code for template declarations ( C++ only) by generating only one copy of each template function where they are defined.	no
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	To use this option successfully, you must mark `#pragmaimplementatio' ( definition) or `#Pragmainterface' ( declaration) in all files that use the template.	no
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', all template instances are external types. You must have the required instance appear in the implementation file.	no
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	This can be achieved with typedef, which references each instance required.	no
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	Correspondingly, if you compile with the default option `-fno-exteznal-templates', all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.	no
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All member functions ( except constructor subfunctions and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class in which they reside.	no
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	This does not mean that every call to a member function will pass through the internal virtual function table.	no
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; This is a direct call to.	no
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch allows the type mismatch of the second and third arguments of a conditional expression.	no
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	The value of such an expression is Void. -fthis-is-variable allows assignment to this ( only for c++) .	no
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	Merging user-defined free storage management mechanisms into C++ makes assignable 'this' seem out of place.	no
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	Therefore, by default, assignment to this inside class member functions is an invalid operation.	no
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	However, for backward compatibility, you can make this work with the '-fthis-is-variable' option.	no
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型, 如同 unsigned char.	no
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Each machine has its own default char type Could be either unsignedchar or signedchar.	no
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	Ideally, a portable program should always use signedchar or unsignedchaz when relying on the symbolic nature of the data.	no
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	But many programs have been written to use only simple char, and expect this to be a signed number ( or unsigned number, depending on the target machine on which the program is written) .	no
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This option, and its antisense option, make such programs work on the corresponding default values.	no
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signedchar or unsignedchar, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.	no
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	These options are used to define signed or unsigned bit fields if the 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifiers are not explicitly declared.	no
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	By default, bit fields are signed because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed numbers, however, if the '-traditional' option is specified, bit fields are always unsigned numbers.	no
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	-fwritable-strings stores string constants in writable data segments without special treatment.	no
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	This is for compatibility with some older programs. They calculate that changing string constants is a very bad idea. The `-traditional' option has the same effect.	no

无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。	In both developed and developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas.	no
吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。	The overall increase in drug use is partly due to large-scale rural-urban movements - more than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.	no
城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。	Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.	no
财富的增加与吸毒情况增多相联，但承受疾病负担最大的是最贫穷的人在世界范围内，发达国家的吸毒情况比发展中国家更为普遍。	Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but it is the poorest who bear the greatest burden of disease. Worldwide, drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.	no

这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。	These patterns appear to be less common in wealthier social classes.	no
全球新冠肺炎危机造成的经济制约很可能会加剧包括吸毒者在内的最弱势群体的风险。	Economic constraints stemming from the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate risks for the most vulnerable, including drug users.	no
例如，劳动力市场的变化，如失业率上升，过去一直与吸毒情况的增加有关，而这场疫情己经迫使全球数千万人失业。	For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been associated with increased drug use in the past, and the pandemic has forced tens of millions of people around the world out of work.	no
新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。	COVID-19 may lead to further expansion of drug markets The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because of reduced control by national authorities, or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the face of the economic crisis.	no
新冠肺炎的相关限制措施导致空中和陆路交通减少，海上贩运可能已经因此而增加，海上的拦截风险低，而且比空中或陆路走私的数量更多。	Trafficking by sea may have increased as a result of COVID-19-related restrictions that have reduced air and land traffic, where the risk of interception is low and higher volumes are smuggled than by air or land.	no

根据所掌握的多数指标，20年来这两个区域甲基苯丙胺的使用一直在扩大。	According to most indicators available, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for 20 years.	no
在一些市场上，可卡因和甲基苯丙胺可以共存，有时是相互替代，这样一种药物的使用量上升时另一种药物的使用量就下降，有时是同时增加和减少以满足同一市场的需求。	In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that the use of one drug rises while the use of the other falls, sometimes increasing and decreasing at the same time to meet demand in the same market.	no
新冠肺炎使注射吸毒者的风险增高	COVID-19 increases the risk for injecting drug users.	no

欧盟峰会为难民政策争吵不休，欧盟官员：接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈	EU summit squabbles over refugee policy, EU officials. There are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process.	yes
【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	[Global Times Special Correspondent Niu Ruifei in Belgium] According to Agence France-Presse reported on February 10, at the latest EU summit on the same day, European Commission President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration. This makes it easier to deport illegal immigrants.	yes
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	The move by the EU is reportedly a response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, where the core issue is the small number of illegal immigrants who can ultimately be repatriated.	yes
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funds" to strengthen external borders, including through infrastructure and surveillance, through means of strengthening external borders.	yes
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	However, the EU has been at loggerheads with member states over issues such as the payment of fence fees.	yes
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not cover the costs.	yes
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	But diplomats from some member states say that if the EU shared the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along the external border, it would free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.	yes
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	EU officials acknowledge that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, that limited reception capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states are unable to prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications across the EU, and that the EU's refugee reception system is in a near-"permanent crisis", according to the European Euractiv website.	yes
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920, 000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half over the previous year.	yes
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	Meanwhile, the European Union recorded more than 330, 000 illegal arrivals last year.	no
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	Against this backdrop, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries could repatriate illegal immigrants based on a court decision in another member state based on a court decision in another member state.	no
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	In addition, EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of a safe state, " which would open the way for the EU to develop a common list, the report said.	no

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	The U.S. escalates its "chip war" and hits the global semiconductor industry hard - Chinanews.com.	yes
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	Recently, the "chip war" between the United States and China has greatly escalated. First, under pressure from the United States, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to start controlling the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China. Later, foreign media reported that the US government is considering cutting off all ties between US suppliers and Huawei and banning US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei. The Biden administration is also preparing to unveil an executive order restricting U.S. investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries... Soon after the beginning of 2023, the United States continued to use malicious tricks to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.	yes
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	In recent years, the United States has never stopped cracking down on the development of China's "core". While accurately suppressing the semiconductor production and supply chain to China, it has built a "de-Sinicization" semiconductor industry chain alliance in an attempt to completely "get rid of" China's advanced semiconductor industry.	yes
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it is to win over South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or to establish a chip "quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a "small circle" in the semiconductor industry chain through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia "quadrilateral mechanism" and the "Indo-Pacific economic framework". The United States attempts to build a closed production and supply chain cycle led by the United States by introducing politicization, camp and weaponization into the semiconductor industry, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry. In order to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.	yes
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	However, the "core tactics" of the United States against China with great fanfare are also "injuring the enemy by one thousand and self-injuring eight hundred".	yes
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	Recently, Fanlin Group, a well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier in the United States, announced that due to the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1300 full-time employees, and plans to lay off 1400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.	yes
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	Global lithography giant Asma Holdings of the Netherlands recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.	yes
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	According to US media analysis, after the US government brutally suppressed China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies suffered, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves and so on.	yes
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.	yes
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, which has long formed a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain.	yes
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	According to professional estimates, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the borders of various countries more than 70 times, and the whole process reaches 100 days.	no
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Although the semiconductor industry in the United States has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capacity, especially in advanced process technology, and relies heavily on East Asia.	no
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	Even if the United States tries its best to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the "small circle" regional development led by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of global semiconductor-related industries are difficult to change.	no
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The United States has strongly "reshaped" and "de-Sinicized" the semiconductor industry chain, which has severely damaged the global semiconductor industry.	no
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the joint participation of countries around the world.	no
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, including the Innovation and Competition Act, the American Competition Act of 2022, and the Chip and Science Act, to consolidate its technological leadership by taking advantage of its technological hegemony. "Enwei" to its allies, to lure Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other chip manufacturers to set up factories in the United States, trying to ensure that the United States has a global leadership position in the chip field.	no
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	In the short term, the United States has indeed created trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and has reaped practical benefits.	no
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	But in the long run, the hysterical suppression of the United States has forced China's chip industry to make continuous breakthroughs and lose its huge Chinese market, which will ultimately greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of American technology companies and damage the development of the global chip industry.	no

然而，个别机构对消费复苏后的健身市场盲目乐观，刚从危机中走出来，又吹响开疆拓土的号角，把融资资金一股脑投入新店建设上。	However, individual institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption. As soon as they emerge from the crisis, they sound the clarion call to expand their territory and invest all the financing funds into the construction of new stores.	no
不可否认，这几年受疫情影响，不少机构退出，行业重新洗牌，有实力的企业此时选择性地加大收购力度、重新布局，未尝不是新机遇。	Undeniably, affected by the epidemic in recent years, many institutions have withdrawn, the industry has been reshuffled, and powerful enterprises have selectively increased their acquisition efforts and re-layout at this time. This may not be a new opportunity.	no
但是，健身市场发展要想进入良性循环，迈上行稳致远的康庄大道，行业就必须改变传统模式，改变经营策略。	However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous circle and embark on a stable and far-reaching road, the industry must change its traditional model and business strategy.	no

没有私教推销，没有巨额年卡，用户对健身机构“跑路”的担忧降低了，信任感也就提升了。	Without private education promotion and a huge annual card, users' worries about fitness institutions running away have decreased, and their trust has also increased.	no
另外，还要积极探索多元业态。	In addition, we must actively explore diversified business formats.	no
如今，体育消费已经从单一服务走向场景消费，健身俱乐部有望成为消费新入口，围绕健身所需的运动补给和健身器械等周边产品或将成为新的盈利点，为消费者提供更丰富选择。	Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from a single service to scenario consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entrance to consumption.

南京楼市再现“差价赔付”-中新网	Nanjing property market reproduces "price difference compensation" - Chinanews.com again.	yes
扬子晚报讯(记者 马祚波)扬子晚报/紫牛新闻记者10日在采访中发现，十余年未见的“保价协议”又重回了南京楼市，位于江北新区的一家楼盘宣称“差价赔付”，在交房前其他房源的优惠大于之前的折扣，开发商愿意为买房人换房并退还差价。	Yangzi Evening News ( Reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangzi Evening News/Ziniu News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the "price protection agreement" that has not been seen for more than ten years has returned to the Nanjing property market. A property located in Jiangbei New District claims to "compensate for the price difference". Before the delivery of the house, the discount of other houses is greater than the previous discount.

There are few houses that buyers can compare prices, so the "threshold" is still quite high. Therefore, the "threshold" is still quite high.	yes

当年8月份，河西黄山路上的楼盘横塘西苑为了吸引买房人眼球，推出了《保价计划》，具体内容为“公司郑重承诺，若一年内项目优惠幅度扩大，由此产生的差额，公司将按差额退还给老业主”。	In August of that year, in order to attract the attention of buyers, Hengtang Xiyuan on Huangshan Road in Hexi Province launched the "Price Protection Plan".

他认为如今开发企业比买房人更需要信心，推出“保价协议”其实也是在给其打气。	He believes that today's development enterprises need more confidence than buyers, the launch of the "price protection agreement" is actually to give it a boost.	no
至于能否留住买房人，他表示这取决于调控政策、贷款门槛等多重因素的影响，就目前来看仍有待观察。	As for whether to retain homebuyers, he said it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, which remains to be seen at present.	no

“无内容，不电商”，随着短视频和直播电商不断发展，人们对电商内容的要求和标准正步入新阶段。	"No content, no e-commerce", with the continuous development of short video and live e-commerce, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.	no

报告认为，电商行业内容生态是一个综合性概念，是将电商与内容进行整合，但并非所有内容都可与电商整合，好的PGC(专业生产内容)与UGC(用户原创内容)才是与电商进行整合的优质载体，内容平台价值越高，消费与推广的场景也就越来越丰富，电商植入的可能性也就越高，商业价值也就越强，这种公共领域和私人领域逐步集成分布的电商内容生产和内容消费的比例也就会越高。	The report believes that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept, which integrates e-commerce with content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC ( professional production content) and UGC ( user original content) are the high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce.

他表示，就内容价值而言，当前电商行业已经从“消费可及性”过渡到“消费品质化”阶段，优质、专业、差异化的内容是电商行业的“硬通货”。	He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumer accessibility" to "consumer quality" stage, and high-quality, professional and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.	no
同时，内容成为电商发展新阶段的根本和抓手，知识付费、专业性知识、KOL(关键意见领袖)等PGC内容开始在电商直播中成为标配。	At the same time, content has become the foundation and starting point of the new stage of e-commerce development, knowledge payment, professional knowledge, KOL ( key opinion leaders) and other PGC content began to become the standard configuration in e-commerce live broadcasting.	no
展望电商行业的未来发展，喻国明提出两方面的建议。	Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.	no
一个是从内容结构提升的角度看，推动电商内容生态健康程度和质量整体提升，打造正向内容创作和管理标准，实现电商行业内容生态健康系统指数与动态均衡。	One is to promote the overall improvement of the ecological health and quality of e-commerce content from the perspective of improving the content structure, create positive content creation and management standards, and achieve the index and dynamic balance of the content ecological health system in the e-commerce industry.	no
另一个是从外部生态看，要实现内容电商行业的健康发展和外部环境的价值协同与共创。	The other is to realize the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment from the perspective of external ecology.	no
“未来电商行业还需要更多的数据、人工智能方面的支持，形成对未来发展稳定性的预测；此外，为商家提供更规范、健康的成长空间，实现电商行业中企业、用户、产品与服务的价值协同，共创健康内容生态。	"In the future, the e-commerce industry will need more data and artificial intelligence support to form a prediction of the stability of future development." In addition, it provides a more standardized and healthy growth space for merchants, realizes the value synergy of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and creates a healthy content ecology.	no

重阳问答︱如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Chongyang Q&A  How to view the US non-farm payrolls data in January exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website - how to see the US non-farm payrolls data greatly exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website	yes
Q：请问重阳投资，如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势？	Q. May I ask how Chongyang Investment views the US non-farm payrolls data in January exceeding expectations and future trends?	yes
A：2月3日美国劳工部公布2023年1月非农就业数据，新增非农就业51.7万人，大幅高于市场预期的18.9万人；失业率降至3.4%，为近50年以来的最低位；时薪同比增速4.4%，环比增速0.3%，略有放缓。	A On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released non-farm employment data for January 2023, adding non-farm employment to 51 new non-farm employment. At 70, 000, it was significantly higher than the market expectations of the 18th. 90, 000 people. Unemployment fell to 3 percent. Fourteen percent - the lowest level in nearly 50 years. Hourly earnings are increasing at a year-on-year rate of 4 per hour. It is up to 4 percent and up to 0 percent. 3, that's slightly slow down.	yes
从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	From the aggregate point of view, there are many one-time and technical disturbances in this data, such as the staff returning from strikes, the revision of the survey statistical caliber, and the update of the quarterly adjustment factor, which may be revised in the future ( referring to the January 2022 increase in non-agricultural employment from 50 to 50 in 2022) . Fourteen thousand people have been repaired to 36 people. Over 70, 000), non-farm payrolls or not as strong as the data suggests.	yes
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is relatively low. High-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care have seen a significant increase in new employment, and data show that there is still a labor gap in the service sector.	yes
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Combined with the same larger-than-expected PMI for the service sector, a recovery in job vacancies and labor gap data, and a strong consumer credit data, we judge that the US service sector has ushered in a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.	yes
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	We believe that it is difficult to improve the supply and demand tension in the US job market without a recession.	yes
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	At present, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor force participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor force participation rate of 25-54 years old is close to the pre-epidemic high.	yes
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	In addition, due to the strength of US residents' excess savings and consumer credit, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of tightening policies on the job market.	yes
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	Continued tight supply and demand in the US job market will be the undercurrent of the US economy in 2023.	yes
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	Superposition is now approaching the end of interest rate hikes, and inflation expectations are constantly repeating. We are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.	no
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Before the release of this data, the US stock and bond exchange market was too optimistic about the Fed's interest rate hike path.	no
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Fed has continued to maintain the fragile balance of market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of interest rate hikes, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statement. It not only expects to stop raising interest rates in advance, but also expects two interest rate cuts at the end of the year. Two interest rate cuts are also expected at the end of the year.	no
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	In the context of tight supply and demand in the labor market and unclear impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on raising interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. The adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded trading may cause some harm to the market.	no
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	Nevertheless, the stubbornness of wage growth cannot change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-leading indicators, the US CPI data has turned to a stage of rapid decline since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only form a foundation for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify. After the release of the next inflation data, the market may enter a new round of gaming.	no

战略方向确定后，杉杉开始寻找合作，那时候鞍山热能院为鞍钢配套的炭素研究所在做国家863课题，科研经费不够，于是杉杉和鞍山热能院碳素研究所签署合作协议，共同推动国家863课题“中间相炭微球”项目产业化，从事负极材料的研发、生产和销售，在国内实现负极材料的商用推广。	After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute supporting Anshan Iron and Steel was working on the national 863 project, and the scientific research funds were not enough, so Shanshan and the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Mesophase Carbon Microspheres" project, engaged in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and realized the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.	yes

The technology content in this field is relatively high. Shanshan's main competitors are the world's top 500 companies, such as Samsung in South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical in Japan, and Nitto Denko in Japan.	no
郑永刚曾分享过投后管理的心得 ， “ 中国的民营企业收购国际上的一些高科技企业，成功概率比较低，为什么那些收购会失败？	Zheng Yonggang once shared the experience of post-investment management, "Chinese private enterprises acquire some international high-tech enterprises, the probability of success is relatively low, why those acquisitions will fail, why those acquisitions will fail." Why do those acquisitions fail?	no
因为大家都会去考虑，我花了那么多钱，我得去派人管对吧，这是通常会做的一个行为 ” ， 然而郑永刚则不同，杉杉收购成功的那一天，郑永刚就到杉金光电当众宣布，杉杉作为杉金的大股东，决定实施一企两制，除了郑永刚担任董事长，杉杉企业的人不派到杉金，采取授权经营的方式，原有的分配制度、企业文化、各项管理等模式不变。	Because everyone will think about it, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to manage it, right? This is a common behavior. However, Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day of the successful acquisition of Shanshan, Zheng Yonggang went to Shanjin Optoelectronics and publicly announced that Shanshan, as a major shareholder of Shanjin, decided to implement one enterprise, two systems.

而且要购买者自已和那个诚信度不怎么样的全峰快递联系，这是自购亚马逊的物品以来最糟糕的一次购物！	And the buyer has to contact Quanfeng Express, whose integrity is not very good, which is the worst shopping since buying Amazon items.	yes
但店家还是不错的，积极配合催促快递及时退款，但是这个全峰快递实在的工作是做的相当让人愤怒，拖拉半个月左右才退款，这种合作伙伴是要拖亚马逊的后腿的，工作效率差，没有服务意识！	But the store is still good, actively cooperating with the courier to urge the timely refund, but the real work of Quanfeng Express is quite infuriating, procrastinating for about half a month before refunding, this kind of partner is to drag Amazon's hind legs, poor work efficiency, no sense of service, no service, but the work of Quanfeng Express is quite infuriating, procrastinating for about half a month.

第一次亚马逊用的合作的天天烂快递，第一次送货没在家，后来主动和快递员约了两次送货时间，那个快递员都不送，后来直接给我退货了，这个该死的快递员一点诚信也没有，强烈建议不要再用那个天天烂快递了。	The first time Amazon used the cooperation of bad delivery every day, the first delivery was not at home, and then took the initiative to make an appointment with the courier for two delivery times, the courier did not deliver, and then directly returned to me, this damn courier has no integrity, strongly recommend not to use that bad delivery every day.

只有两种可能，要么次品旧品，要么就是我故意损坏商品，然后拿去退货。	There are only two possibilities, either defective and old, or I deliberately damaged the product and took it back.	yes

我使用该产品不到一年，就出现两个E2，我不知道如何处理?	I use this product less than a year, there are two E2, I do not know how to deal with it, I do not know how to deal with it.	yes
我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?	I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, red E2 often appeared in the two groups on the right side of the receiver. It should be a problem with the transmitter module. This is not consistent with the continuous work of the transmitter module mentioned on the Amazon website. It can not find after-sales service on the Amazon website. I don't know what to do now. I don't know what to do about it. I don't know what to do.	yes

I called the supplier directly and said that it was genuine if there was no mark.

订单编号：503-4265464-1830254。	Order number 503-4265464-1830254	yes
我当初购买的页面尺码选项为7c，8，9c，当时觉得这就是个陷阱，打电话给日亚中文客服，明确告知8就是8c，但是等商品回到中国才发现，只有8cm，我觉得这完全是故意设下的陷阱来坑中国人（按照亚马逊的售后），现在查看页面已没有这个选项。	The page size options I originally purchased were 7c, 8, and 9c. At that time, I thought it was a trap. I called the Japanese-Asian Chinese customer service and clearly informed that 8 was 8c. However, when the product returned to China, I found that it was only 8cm. I think this is completely a trap deliberately set to pit Chinese people ( according to Amazon's after-sales service) . Now there is no such option on the viewing page.	yes
中方客服：很抱歉，给你带来损失了，我们给你两条路走：	Chinese customer service. Sorry for the loss, we give you two ways to go.	yes

2，你不退货，我们补偿你1000日元。	2. If you do not return the goods, we will compensate you 1, 000 yen.	yes
（我算一下账，鞋子4000多日元，算作200rmb，选择1，我没有鞋子，损失在200元。	( I calculate the account, shoes more than 4000 yen, counted as 200rmb, choose 1, I do not have shoes, the loss is 200 yuan in the 200 yuan.) .	yes
选择2，我有鞋子，最后补偿了我2000日元，最后损失在150rmb 客服：我们已记录下来，我们会认真处理，次日回了封邮件，说我不接受中方客服调解，就这么完了。	Option 2, I have shoes, finally compensated me 2, 000 yen, the final loss in 150rmb customer service. We have recorded it, and we will deal with it seriously. We replied to an email the next day, saying that I do not accept mediation from Chinese customer service, and that it was over.	yes
我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	And I offered that. When the purchase page has confusing options such as 7c, 8, and 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me tell me that the commonly used codes in Japan do not come with c, similar to 140, but did you go to other caterpillar pages to see them?	yes
都有美码，日码混标的情况出现。	Both US and Japanese codes have mixed standards.	no
再说，你8cm为什么放在7c和9c中间，明明最小的尺码，你放那里算什么意思。	Besides, why did you put 8cm between 7c and 9c? It's the smallest size. What do you mean by putting it there?	no
中方客服：我们提供中文服务，但是不知道你要运回国，所以你的运费我们是不予理赔的。	Chinese customer service. We provide Chinese service, but we don’ t know that you are going to ship it back to China, so we will not compensate for your shipping cost.	no
这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	I don't understand this logic again. I am Japanese, and I still need Chinese customer service. China living in Japan doesn't need Chinese customer service either. Tourists to Japan don't have that kind of kung fu to make international long-distance calls. Then the question arises. Who needs to call Amazon overseas to buy Chinese phone calls, nothing more than a Japanese Tao like me.	no
亚马逊中文客服不就是方便了我们海淘的这些人吗？	Isn't Amazon Chinese customer service just these people who are convenient for us overseas shopping?	no
这次购买不是很满意	This purchase is not very satisfactory.	yes
这是第二次从亚马逊上购买帮宝适尿布，曾经在宝宝2个月的时候买过一箱，选择了欧洲进口纸张的尿布，第一次购买经历还是比较满意的，宝宝整夜就用一张尿布，的确可以满足12个小时不换尿布。	This is the second time to buy Pampers diapers from Amazon. I once bought a box when my baby was 2 months old and chose diapers imported from Europe. The first purchase experience was satisfactory. The baby used a diaper all night. It can indeed meet 12 hours without changing diapers.	yes
但是这次购买L号的尿布，一箱里面有2包分开包装，打开后就觉得纸张比较松，跟进口帮宝适有明显区别，给宝宝用了之后，还算可以，没有漏尿也没有红疹等迹象。	But this time I bought L-size diapers, and there are 2 packs in a box packed separately. After opening it, I feel that the paper is relatively loose, which is obviously different from imported Pampers. After using it for my baby, it is OK. There is no leakage of urine and there is no sign of rash.	yes
但是到了第二包尿布，开始使用后宝宝的大腿内侧立马就出现了红疹，至今还没有褪去。	But by the second pack of diapers, the baby's inner thighs immediately developed a rash after starting to use them, which has not yet faded yet.	yes
怀疑1箱里面的2包，质量还不一样啊。	I suspect that the quality of the 2 packages in 1 box is not the same.	yes
以后应该不会继续购买了！	Should not continue to buy in the future.	yes
希望重视包裹的运输保护	Hope to attach importance to the transportation protection of parcels.	yes
这是我网购这么久以来，看到最差的一次包装运输，完全没有什么保护措施，缓冲泡沫，包裹缓冲层材料等，什么都没有。	This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen since I have been shopping online for so long. There are no protective measures at all, such as cushioning foam, wrapping cushioning layer materials, etc., nothing is possible.	yes
就一个压变形的箱子。	Just a deformed box.	yes
而且里面的软胶盒包装的，卡盒都压开了压到变形了。	Moreover, the soft plastic box inside was packed, and the card box was pressed open and deformed.	yes
希望是正品 质量有保证，以后是不怎么敢亚马孙买东西的了。	I hope that the quality of the authentic product is guaranteed, and I will not dare to buy things from Amazon in the future.	yes
宁愿国内贵一半，有保障点。	I'd rather be half as expensive at home and have some security.	yes
而且商品产品包装问题，我看评论2016年就有人评论过，到现在19年，还是老样子。	Moreover, the issue of product packaging has been commented on since 2016. Now, in 19 years, it has been the same.	yes
说明亚马逊根本就不重视服务反馈这一块，和国内的京东、天猫等差太远了。	It shows that Amazon does not attach importance to service feedback at all, and it is too far away from domestic JD.com and Tmall.	yes
好看，但有点点小遗憾	Nice, but with a little pity.	yes
整个杯子的颜色是我狠喜欢的，橘红色，虽然我家是男宝，但是还是觉得橘红配黄色很亮眼。	The color of the whole cup is my favorite, orange-red. Although my family is a male treasure, I still think orange-red and yellow are very eye-catching.	yes
比我想象的小一些，不过本来就是拿来带出门用的，所以还可以接受。	It's smaller than I thought, but it's meant to be taken out, so it's acceptable.	yes
昨晚拿回家试了一下，瓶盖推开之后，吸管和盖子之间的距离太近了，因为吸管的位置是正向垂直的，所以儿子总是要把盖子上面的凸起含住喝水，觉得这个地方是否可以改进一下。	I took it home and tried it last night. After the bottle cap was pushed open, the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the position of the straw was positive and vertical, my son always had to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water. I wonder if this place can be improved.	yes
看来其他牌子的吸管杯把吸管做的倾斜还是有道理的，小孩子的东西，真的就是在乎安全和舒适。	It seems that it makes sense for other brands of straw cups to tilt the straw. Children's things really care about safety and comfort.	yes
轻便大容量	Lightweight and large capacity.	yes
喜欢它轻便，开口大，就是两个独立的分隔袋对我来说有点多余，感觉不知道装什么好。	I like that it is lightweight and has a large opening, but the two separate compartments are a bit redundant for me. I don't know what to pack.	yes
买完发现海外购美亚上还有一只另一个牌子很类似的，才不到两百块。	After buying it, I found that there is another brand very similar on the overseas purchase of Meiya. It is less than 200 yuan.	yes
假货，假的特别厉害	Fake goods, fake ones are particularly powerful.	yes
亚马逊卖假货，我也是服了。	Amazon sells counterfeit goods, and I am also convinced.	yes
客服说因为用了所以不能退货，我没用怎么知道是假货。	The customer service said that it cannot be returned because it was used. How can I know if it's a fake if I don't use it?	yes
因为信任，所以伤心，毕竟是抹脸的用品，真的去实体店买吧，认可贵一点。	Because of trust, so sad, after all, is to wipe the face of supplies, really go to the physical store to buy it, recognize the valuable point.	yes
因为是秒杀，所以没有看评论，我已经提交国家工商总局的电商平台了，我们一起维权吧。	Because it is a second kill, I did not read the comments. I have submitted it to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let's defend our rights together.	yes
坏了？	It broke.	yes
假货？	Fake goods.	yes
总之悲剧。	In short, tragedy.	yes
用第二片的时候选的毛孔细致的，但是一打开就一股怪味，以为是正常的，因为没用过这款，然后往脸上贴的时候就整个受不了了，非常冲的味道，无法形容，熏到立马咳嗽了出来，眼睛也很痛，流眼泪，马上摘了去洗脸。	When using the second piece, the pores were fine, but as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal, because I hadn't used this one before, and then I couldn't stand it when I put it on my face. The smell was very punchy and indescribable. I smoked to the point of coughing out immediately. My eyes were also very painful and tears flowed. I immediately took it off and washed my face.	yes
不信邪又开了一片同款的，没有那么重的味道了，现在正在敷。	Do not believe in evil and opened a piece of the same, not so heavy taste, now is applying to the paint is now applied.	yes
回想起有点像发廊里劣质烫发水的味道。	In retrospect, it smells like shoddy perm water in a hair salon.	yes
真无法想象，难倒亚马逊自营的护肤品从此也得避而远之了吗？	It's really unimaginable that Amazon's own skin care products will have to be avoided from now on.	yes
奸商啊	Profiteers.	yes
当时购买的时候，活动页面上是说满99元赠送“三体全集”，收到货没有这个赠品，打客服电话说要给他们看当时活动的截图，问题是谁买东西还把网页截图保存啊，你们自己做过的活动，还需要顾客帮你们提供啊，各位买家下次要留个心眼，保存证据。	At the time of purchase, the activity page said that the "Complete Works of the Three-Body Problem" would be given as a gift for 99 yuan. When I received the goods, I didn't have this gift. I called the customer service and said that I would show them the screenshots of the event at that time. The question is who bought things and saved the screenshots of the webpage. You also need customers to provide you with the activities you have done yourself. Buyers should keep an eye on it next time and save evidence.	yes
用后感受	Feel after use.	yes
第一次在亚马逊买东西，分别感受有几点，先来说下用完商品的感受吧，第一确实是无痛，也没有刺激味道的东西，总体来说很不错的，静等8分钟左右一擦就掉了，只是会有少量的汗毛渣在上面，不细看是看不出来的，所以说总体是不错的，至于之后都就用一次还要继续观察，继续用才会知道。	The first time I bought something on Amazon, I felt a few points respectively. Let's talk about the feeling of using up the product first. The first thing is really painless and there is no stimulating taste. Generally speaking, it is very good. After waiting for about 8 minutes, it will fall off after wiping it off, but there will be a small amount of hair residue on it. You can't see it without looking at it in detail, so it's generally good. As for using it once after that, you have to continue to observe it. If you continue to use it, you will know that you will know that if you continue to use it.	yes
反正我觉得这个东西确实不错。	Anyway, I think this thing is really good.	yes
第二从27号下单，12号收到货，总共15天也就是半个月，亚马逊的送货员服务态度也很好。	The second order was placed from the 27th and received on the 12th for a total of 15 days, that is, half a month. Amazon's delivery staff also had a good service attitude.	yes
第三，亚马逊的什么黑色星期五就不要相信了，星期五下单，等了2天就便宜了接近12块钱，也就是我买成170多（加上运费什么的），有一种搞活动就提价格的感觉样。	Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday. If you place an order on Friday and wait for 2 days, it will be nearly 12 yuan cheaper, that is, I bought it for more than 170 yuan ( plus freight and so on) . There is a feeling of raising the price when engaging in activities.	yes
客服说什么价格波动，我关注了10多天价格也就是这个样，波动也不大的。	What did the customer service say about price fluctuations? I have been following the price for more than 10 days, and it's just like this. The fluctuation is not big.	yes
价格实惠，日原产，有中文标签，带颗粒，绝对回购！	Affordable, Japanese origin, with Chinese labels, with particles, absolute repurchase.	yes
膏体里带颗粒的，清爽感恰到好处，用后牙齿爽滑，上比某二手东强太多啦，那里说是进口的东西，可好多东西没有中文标签，不知从哪里批发的。	There are particles in the paste, the refreshing feeling is just right, the teeth are smooth after use, which is much stronger than a second-hand Dongqiang, where it is said that it is imported, but many things do not have Chinese labels, I do not know from where wholesale. I do not know where wholesale.	yes
以后只要亚马逊有的，绝不再去二手东。	In the future, as long as Amazon has it, it will never go to second-hand East again.	yes

结果竟然中午12点就直接上门送了，也不事先电话告知。	As a result, it was delivered directly to the door at 12 noon, and it was not told in advance by phone.	yes

不会有任何改变或者补偿！	No change or compensation will be made.	no
之前也是遇到这样子了类似配送时间不对的问题也就忍了，但这次无法忍受，太过分了！	Before also encountered this kind of problem similar to the wrong delivery time also put up with, but this time can not stand, too much points, too much, too much.	no
新书买的预售到货后竟然封面和封底是反的，这样子明显得质量问题就这样子闭眼把书发给顾客了？	After the pre-sale of the new book arrived, the cover and back cover were reversed, so there was an obvious quality problem, so I closed my eyes and sent the book to the customer like this.	no
留言差评也不会有人来联系你。	Leave a bad review and no one will contact you if you leave it on.	no
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	Excellence has been getting worse and worse over the years, and there is no service quality at all.	no
不会再在卓越上花一毛钱。	Won't spend another dime on excellence.	no
图片质量实在不能接受	Image quality is simply unacceptable.	yes
作为“古地图集”这样的标题，本书在图片的选择、排版、印刷上实在令人难以接受，有些图片甚至有马赛克，模糊到无法辨识。	As a title like "Ancient Atlas", the selection, typesetting, and printing of pictures in this book are really unacceptable. Some pictures even have mosaics, which are too blurry to be recognized.	yes
即便本书不是专业的地图册，即便是小画幅插图，也应该对得起目录中祖先留下来的洋洋大观的中古文献资料！	Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is illustrated in small format, it should be worthy of the magnificent medieval literature left by the ancestors in the catalogue.	yes
（况且很多图片是可以从相关行业资源中获取清晰的原始文件的），用这样的图片来拼凑图书与不使用图片有何差别？	( Moreover, many pictures can get clear original documents from relevant industry resources.) What is the difference between using such pictures to piece together books and not using pictures?	yes
！我为这样的治学精神感到遗憾。	I feel sorry for such a scholarly spirit.	yes
文字方面不予评价，方家各有分辨。	The text is not evaluated, and the Fang family has their own distinctions.	yes
整体2星。	Overall 2 stars.	yes
高二的时候看的这本书当时只是抱着无聊看看玩的心态，感觉这样的书自己应该不会沉迷吧，毕竟起点的网文以往还是不太吸引我的。	When I read this book in the second year of high school, I just read and played with boredom. I feel that I should not indulge in such a book. After all, the online articles of the starting point were not very attractive to me in the past.	yes
然后...就掉坑里了。	Then it just closes the window.   It fell into the pit.	yes
按着这个剧情来说，整本书都是比较轻松愉快的，前部分叶修还在网游里的时候，即使是公会之间勾心斗角，也因为往往被叶神狗血，搞得一点也不沉重。	According to this plot, the whole book is relatively relaxed and pleasant. When Ye Xiu was still in the online game in the first part, even the intrigue between the guilds was often caused by the blood of God Ye, which was not heavy at all.	yes
至于到了比赛的部分，写出了时代的变迁新旧交替的一点点心酸之感（可能是我多愁善感）。	As for the part of the game, I wrote a little sadness about the change of times and the alternation of old and new ( maybe I am sentimental) .	yes
看整部书花了我高二许多学习时间，可是就是停不下来。	Reading the whole book took me a lot of study time in the second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.	yes
全职对人物和感情线的描写让人十分惊艳，有的人物只是偶尔带过，也会给人留下很深的影响，像比较重点描写的角色叶修黄少天苏沐橙都有大量的粉丝，而不在写作中心的角色例如江波涛楚云秀等等也十分找人喜欢，在一个电竞的爽文中竟然让人找不到一个让人讨厌至极的人物，这是全职在人物描写上的成功。	Full-time description of characters and emotional lines is very amazing, some characters are only occasionally brought, but also leave a deep impact on people, such as Ye Xiuhuang Shaotian Su Mucheng, who is described more emphatically, has a large number of fans, while characters not in the writing center, such as Jiang Botao Chu Yunxiu, are also very popular. In an e-sports cool article, people can't find a character that is extremely annoying. This is a full-time success in character description.	yes
而在感情线上，全职也没有一般网文所令人诟病的后宫佳丽三千万要么美女要么腐的毛病，全文所有人的感情，都有一个共同的地方就是他们喜欢着荣耀这个游戏，并且大都想要堂堂正正的胜利。	On the emotional line, there is no such thing as the 30 million beauties in the harem that are criticized by ordinary online articles or rotten problems. Everyone's feelings in the full text have one thing in common, that is, they like the game of glory, and most of them want to win fair and square.	yes
小计量有却没有什么大阴谋，每个人看上去都那么单纯可爱。	Small measurements have no big conspiracy, everyone looks so simple and cute.	yes
这或许也是为什么全职没有什么令人讨厌的角色。	This may also be why there are no annoying roles full-time.	yes
全职的IP很大，也归功于此。	Full-time IP is very large, also thanks to this.	yes
撇开网文这个文化现象不谈，全职不失为一本不错的书。	Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of online articles, full-time is a good book.	no
多少他真的会给人提供一些热血，一点点感动。	How much he will really provide people with some blood, a little touched a little bit.	no
今年4月份全职要动漫化。	In April this year, full-time anime will be made.	no
其实想要买齐这套书很久了，碍于永远钱包不够厚都没狠下心下手，然后想要买的时候就发现，tb上简直是假货猖獗，其实全职最近出了另一个版本，封面图吧我自己是蛮喜欢的，但还是打算先买老的版本，所以就在亚马逊上看了看，一次性买下来了一套。	In fact, I have been wanting to buy this set of books for a long time, because my wallet is never thick enough, and then when I wanted to buy it, I found that fakes are rampant on tb. In fact, full-time recently released another version. I really like the cover picture, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I read it on Amazon and bought a set at once. I bought a set at once.	no
接下来简单说一下货的情况。	Next, let's briefly talk about the situation of the goods.	no
●第四本的塑封没有，但书是新的。	● The plastic seal of the fourth book is not available, but the book is a new one.	no
●第十七本塑封是在但是被打开了，书的质感也很奇怪感觉没有其他的硬。	● The seventeenth book plastic seal is in but was opened, the texture of the book is also very strange feeling that there is no other hardness.	no
●第23本和第十七本情况一样，但是也比第十七本硬，但十分的旧。	● The 23rd book is the same as the 17th book, but it is also harder than the 17th book, but it is very old.	no
●个别几本书的出版社不同好像第23和17就是同一个出版社，和其他的不同。	● Individual books have different publishers as if 23rd and 17th are the same publisher, different from other books.	no
●整体来讲还算满意，24本很大一箱，很满足。	● As a whole, I am quite satisfied. 24 books are a large box, which is very satisfying.	no
落寞的小狮子	The lonely little lion was a lonely lion.	yes
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner". As a result, there were still a lot of words.	yes
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	I read it three times before I finished reading it to the children, a little lion who can shoot, a little lion who loves to eat fruit juice soft candy.	yes
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	When I saw the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urbanites can't accept the arrangement of being eaten by animals.	yes
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	Seeing that in the end, this little lion who succeeded in human society lost himself, he was no longer a complete lion, nor a complete human being.	yes
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	In the end, there was only the back of the little lion. I don't know where he went.	yes
可能多年以后，这个小狮子的形象还留在长大了的小朋友的印象中，在某一天不经意的时候被想起，或许对她会有触动或是启发。	Perhaps many years later, the image of this little lion will remain in the impression of the grown-up children, and it will be remembered inadvertently one day, which may touch or inspire her.	yes
性价比很高的作品集	Cost-effective portfolio.	yes
1、以前还不知道TASCHEN，最近买了不少他们的书，原因就是太强悍，不论是选题还是制作本身。	1. I didn't know TASCHEN before. I bought a lot of their books recently. The reason is that they are too tough, whether it is the topic selection or the production itself.	yes
本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	This work has been published in three versions, the largest version and the Michelangelo complete works, are close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide. The middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide. This edition is the smallest, and it comes with a two-volume book edition with a book box.	yes
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	Personally, I think it's acceptable. First, the price is cheap, and more than 700 pages are divided into two books. As a paperback book, it's better to read it. Second, unlike Michelangelo's Complete Works, paintings account for the main body. Leonardo da Vinci's black-and-white manuscript accounts for the majority. For readers with limited budgets and non-art majors, this edition is the highest cost-effective for appreciating paintings and manuscripts. The highest cost-effectiveness of appreciation works and manuscripts is the highest.	yes
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	2. The explanation of the painting part is great, including composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background ( such as the Last Supper), but I don't know whether it's the printing or the size of the book. Some shaded parts are too deep to see the details. It's a pity that they can't see the details.	yes
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer in content.	yes
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius, while the latter has a wide range of range and high achievements, which is not enough to describe as a genius.	yes
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	If you had only seen half of Leonardo da Vinci's paintings before, you would have no language after reading the manuscript.	yes
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Rubbish, whoever buys it regrets it.	yes
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	Never give bad reviews, this sincere garbage, bought a waste of money God horse, give a reason to give a reason.	yes
1.走时不准，突然变成1月1号，时间归零了。	1. Travel time is not accurate, suddenly it becomes January 1st, time returns to zero.	yes

6.不防水。	6. Not waterproof.	yes
7.其他。	7. other	yes
物流太慢	Logistics is too slow.	yes
显示10月16号到，结果21号才收到，差评！	It shows that it arrived on October 16th, but it was only received on the 21st. Bad review.	yes
快递太差，亚马逊上买东西本来就慢，没想到会这么慢！	The delivery is too bad. Shopping on Amazon is already slow. I didn't expect it to be so slow.	yes
总体满意	Overall satisfaction.	yes
之前一开始还担心相机的包装，这次还好，里面有充气包，相机三码一致，也能在官网注册，快门次数0，其余的就只能等时间检验了 。	At first, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was okay. There was an inflatable bag inside. The camera had the same three codes. It could also be registered on the official website. The number of shutters was 0, and the rest could only wait for time to be checked.	yes
发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	The delivery speed is quite fast. I would like to complain about the courier here. The valuables are placed in the concierge and go very fast. I can't open the box for inspection in front of him. I am really speechless about this.	yes
商家发货前做到了为客户着想:)	The merchant did it for the sake of the customer before shipping:)	yes
商家比较负责，专门打电话问所用相机的屏幕尺寸，确实替客户着想了。	The merchant is more responsible, specifically calling to ask about the screen size of the camera used, and really thinks about the customer for the sake of the customer.	yes
发货速度也快。	Shipping speed is also fast.	yes
金刚膜贴上去也挺合适和管用的。	The diamond film is also quite suitable and effective when applied.	yes
电池充不满	The battery is not fully charged.	yes
机器确实不错，想问下怎么第一次充电起就充不满啊，充电指示灯一直红色	The machine is really good. I would like to ask why it is not fully charged from the first time it is charged. The charging indicator is always red.	yes
目前找不到亚马逊官方反馈渠道，所以只能在商品评价里反馈	At present, the official feedback channel of Amazon cannot be found, so feedback can only be found in the product evaluation.	yes
1. 在 3 月 29 号，通过预购途径使用 31 元购买了此书，显示 3 月 31 号会推送到设备上，此时亚马逊官网上还无法预览该书（因为还未发布）；	1. On March 29th, I purchased the book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, indicating that it will be pushed to the device on March 31st. At this time, the book cannot be previewed on Amazon's official website ( because it has not yet been released) .	yes
2. 3 月 31 号推送到设备上的书，内容是空白，只有敬请期待，而亚马逊上该书电子版降价到了 18 元；	2 The content of the book pushed to the device on March 31 is blank, only stay tuned, and the price of the electronic version of the book on Amazon has been reduced to 18 yuan.	yes
3. 这两天反复尝试将设备上的下载的空白的书进行删除，再次同步，都无法获取到包含实际内容的电子版《商业的本质》，但是看到亚马逊官网已经可以预览该书。	3. Over the past two days, repeated attempts to delete the downloaded blank book on the device and synchronize it again have failed to obtain the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" containing the actual content, but Amazon's official website has been able to preview the book.	yes
目前我有几点感想	At present, I have a few thoughts.	yes
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	1. The issue of price is actually not the most important, the key is how to replace the blank book on the kindle with a book with actual content, instead of downloading it forever and saying "stay tuned" are all "stay tuned".	yes
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	2 Pre-ordered books should not be bought again in the future, after all, in case of a jump, and then download a book with empty content, the procedure looks very complicated.	yes
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	3. I hope that Amazon can provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues. When you have doubts about the download or use of e-books, you can have local feedback ( work orders and online customer service are OK, you can refer to how Microsoft's official mall does it) .	yes
不是很推荐阅读	Not very recommended reading.	yes
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it. Write something from memory and feel it after reading it.	yes
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	This book is not so much a collection of short stories as a collection of fragments of life about love.	yes
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The tone of this book is extremely plain, as plain as boiled water, the pursuit of simplicity of words and sentences to the extreme, and the plot is like a summer afternoon street, quiet and plain.	yes
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Each short story is a silhouette of a short period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no endings.	yes
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	Finally collected together, titled What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,	yes
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I think this collection of novels, as well as its title, is like a kind of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not only the joys and sorrows on the stage, the sea is dry and the rocks are rotten in urban legends, and it is not just the glue of you and me. Love is not only the above nor should it be represented by the above. Love is also a plain life like water, boring day after day, but also the helplessness of life, the escape of reality, and the loss of the future at a loss.	yes
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	As you read this book, your mind may recall the quarreling couple next to you, the dull marriages of people you know, and unhappy relationships.	yes
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	That's why I don't recommend reading it, from an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are dull, and unless your life is rough or as sweet as living in a candy castle, you have to read it with the feeling of being surprised and bored or boring.	yes
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	From the depth of thought, the daily plot does not brighten one's eyes or expand one's thinking and vision ( this is different from Márquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the short clips do not explore any questions, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love.	yes
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	The breakdown of the protagonist's marriage comes from those reasons.	no
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	So I don't recommend reading this book. It doesn't make much sense to read it or not.	no
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and genre than storyline, which is also the reason for the poor reading experience of this book.	no
适合粗读,不能细看。	Suitable for rough reading, not close reading.	yes
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	The logic of this book is good, but the content is not full enough.	yes
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	It explains what and why many sales theories are, but it is weak in terms of how to do it. It only points out the direction but does not give specific practices.	yes
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	Plus, the book feels like a patchwork.	yes
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	For example, there are both domestic and foreign; there are well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and unknown people.	yes
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	I don't know if the story is compiled for example, but it will be more convincing to cite some cases experienced by the author himself.	yes
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	Change the title of the customer or customer.	yes
标题上还是顾客,正文中就变成客户了。	The title is still the customer, the text becomes the customer, the text becomes the customer.	yes
电子书中还出现了错别字、标点符号缺失、编号错误的问题。	There are also typos, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering in e-books.	yes
总之,这本书作为理论入门是个不错的选择,但对于已经从事销售工作想要提高销售水平的人就不太适用了。	In short, this book is a good choice as an introduction to theory, but it is not suitable for people who are already engaged in sales work and want to improve their sales level.	yes
快速了解互联网金融的导读书	A quick understanding of the guide to Internet finance.	yes
这本书很浅，可以说只是一个入门课，可以帮助大家快速了解互联网金融的全貌，但要深入了解，还是要按图索骥，自己去深挖。	This book is very shallow, it can be said that it is only an introductory course, which can help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but to understand it in depth, you still have to follow the map and dig deep yourself.	yes
且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	And the book was written earlier, and later Alipay WeChat borrowed subsidies to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned. Today's third-party payment share is not so small as mentioned in the book.	yes
现在好多人外出吃饭都是带个手机就好，商家也因为银行流水太高的原因，弃用银联了。	Nowadays, many people go out to eat with just a mobile phone. Merchants have also abandoned UnionPay because of the high flow of banks.	yes
但还是非常感谢作者写出这本入门书，看得出作者起码有多年的金融观察经验，对国内外的金融发展史都十分熟悉，所以才能写成如此通俗易懂的内容。	But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of experience in financial observation and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.	yes
写高大空很容易，难的是写的通俗易懂。	It's easy to write tall and empty, but the difficulty is that it's easy to understand in the world.	yes
欣赏你，更想让你知道！	Appreciate you and want you to know more.	yes
决定一个人工作满意度的第一要素不是薪水高低，而是在工作中是否得到了足够重视和赏识。	The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not their salary, but whether they are valued and appreciated enough in their work.	yes
根据马斯洛需求层次理论，在人的基本生存需要得到满足后，最迫切的就是心理需要的满足——希望被理解、被肯定、被赏识。	According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, after people's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent thing is to meet their psychological needs-hope to be understood, affirmed and appreciated.	yes
确实，对于国人来说，大部分是“爱你在心口难开”，即便是怀有爱、感激与赞赏也是默默放在心里不会说出来。	Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them are "love you in the heart is difficult to open", even if they have love, gratitude and appreciation, they will not say it in their hearts.	yes
作者在本书中阐述了五种赞赏的语言：肯定的言辞、精心时刻、服务的行为、称心的礼物、身体接触。	In this book, the author elaborates on five languages of appreciation. words of affirmation, meticulous moments, acts of service, pleasing gifts, physical contact, physical contact.	yes
我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	I think the important thing is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can appreciate and appreciate the people around you, whether they are family, friends or colleagues, from the bottom of your heart anytime, anywhere.	yes
其实越是亲密的人越需要赞赏和感恩，这样我们的生活才会变得更加美好。	In fact, the closer people are, the more they need appreciation and gratitude, so that our lives will become better.	yes
学会赞赏，企业也能在一定程度上挽留住人才，降低辞职率。	Learn to appreciate that enterprises can also retain talents to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.	yes
感谢译者给我们带来了精彩的国外的思想和世界。	Thank you to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign ideas and the world.	yes
由于中西方文化背景等原因，语言之间或多或少会存在差异，如果有机会能看到作者原版相信会收获更多。	Due to Chinese and Western cultural backgrounds and other reasons, there will be more or less differences between languages. If you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, I believe you will gain more.	yes
再次谢谢作者和译者以及编辑们的辛勤劳动！	Thanks again to the authors, translators and editors for their hard work and hard work.	no
疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	Suspected shoddy goods, please Amazon strict review.	yes
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, and it is not even as good as the roadside stall products. There is no weight, no bar code, and the ten-bag packaging is also loose. It is not a characteristic of qualified products at all. This is Amazon's worst shopping experience and has applied for a return. It's all about quality. It is recommended that merchants keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods. Supplementary. I also bought Xinxiangyin, 23 yuan/10 rolls in the supermarket, and added several comparative photos to further verify the authenticity of the product. In order to give consumers a clearer reference and avoid economic losses and further unhappy mood.	yes
再度期望亚马逊能够一丝不苟，严把商品源头。	Again, I hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strictly control the source of goods.	yes
马马虎虎的产品，和期望有差距	There is a gap between mediocre products and expectations.	yes
优点：	Advantages.	yes
1. 大品牌，价格便宜。	1. Big brand, cheap price.	yes
优点2：电机和刀片都是PANASONIC保证的，使用起来也还OK，但是和我期望有差距。	Advantage 2 The motor and blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are OK to use, but there is a gap between them and my expectations.	yes
缺点：	Disadvantages	yes
1. 充电没有指示灯，这个最基本你的电源指示都省下了，估计购买300元产品的客户，在松下PANASONIC的眼里，也是施舍，毫无尊重。	1. There is no indicator light for charging, which saves you the most basic power indicator. It is estimated that customers who buy products for 300 yuan, in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC, are also alms and have no respect.	yes
2. 有强烈的异味 充电时候，哪怕仅仅充电10分钟，就可以闻到强烈的塑胶燃烧的那种味道。	2 There is a strong odor when charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of plastic burning.	yes
办公室试用了1天，搞的全屋子都是这种塑胶味道。	The office tried it out for 1 day, and the whole house smelled like plastic.	yes
和我之前用过的同价位的飞利浦PHILIPS相比，虽然多了个刀头，但是松下这款产品，质量真是对不起消费者了。	Compared with the Philips PHILIPS at the same price I have used before, although there is an extra knife head, the quality of Panasonic's product is really sorry for consumers.	yes
小包装	Small package.	yes
收到快递一看上面写着电商版就知道又掉坑里了，比超市买的小了好些，应该是M，跟商品介绍上面的图片包装不一样，所谓新版吧。	When I received the express delivery, I saw that the e-commerce version had fallen into the pit again. It was smaller than the supermarket. It should be M, which is different from the picture packaging above the product introduction. The so-called new version, right?	yes
三颗星是怪自己马虎没看清楚商品规格，你卖M码电商版我没意见，你货不对版是几个意思？	The three stars blame themselves for not seeing the product specifications clearly. I have no problem with you selling the M-size e-commerce version. What does it mean that your product is not the right version?	yes
电商套路深，有时间还是去超市买了。	E-commerce routines are deep, so I still go to the supermarket to buy them when I have time.	yes
就酱紫。	just sauce purple	yes
味道不喜欢	I don’ t like the taste.	yes
小孩很不喜欢牙膏的味道，每次都说辣，也许用别的词形容才更贴切，小孩的词库里暂时只有这个词。	Children don't like the taste of toothpaste very much. They say it spicy every time. Perhaps it is more appropriate to use other words to describe it. For the time being, only this word is in the child's vocabulary.	yes
搞活动时候买的，很便宜，所以也不好意思给差评了，四星吧，不过不会再买了。	I bought it during the event and it was very cheap, so I'm sorry to give it a bad review. Four stars, but I won't buy it again.	yes
正品哟 包装好	Genuine yo well packaged.	yes
包装很完整，里面加了充气袋，没有网上评论的只有光秃秃一个产品的样子。	The packaging is very complete, with an inflatable bag added inside. There are no online reviews, only the appearance of a bare product.	yes
瓶子外包装上还有一层塑料膜像图片上描述的一样，快递也很快，拍下第二天就来了。	There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle, as described in the picture, and the express delivery is also very fast, and it arrived the next day after taking the photo.	yes
是正品，只是没货了，不知道什么时候再上架。	It's authentic, but it's out of stock. I don't know when it will be on the shelves again.	yes
糟心的一次购物体验	A bad shopping experience.	yes
黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	I placed the order on Black Friday, but I waited for a long time and didn't receive it. When I checked later, the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues around me and said that they didn't help sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but said that the sender could only initiate the inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. I finally figured out that the courier was mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several turnarounds, I finally got the courier back. The outer packaging has been removed, and the goods are still complete. I don't know if they have been used. In short, it's very bad.	yes
错误的配图	Wrong picture.	yes
我以为自己能够收到图1这样的耳机，没想到却收到了图2这样的耳机，图物不一致也就算了，耳机左右声音大小不一又是什么意思？	I thought I could receive headphones like Figure 1, but I didn't expect to receive headphones like Figure 2. Even if the pictures are inconsistent, what does it mean that the sound size of the left and right headphones is different? What does it mean?	yes
虽然名称都是一样的，但还是希望大家能够小心注意，另外还请亚马逊负责人及时更换正确的配图，万分感谢。	Although the names are all the same, I hope everyone can pay attention to them carefully. In addition, I would like to ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct picture in time. Thank you very much.	yes
操作系统一般般	The operating system is generally like the operating system.	yes
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	Used for a period of time, the overall picture is OK, do not feel any difference, that is, the system makes people look tangled, boot time is obviously a little slow, can not be set up well, and then the software does not need to be commented on, the response speed that is more general, and colleagues compared to the home that is not an order of magnitude. Compared with colleagues, it is not an order of magnitude.	yes
看评论说很人性化的设计，我没有找到哪里人性化，遥控器这个常用的上下左右，返回键设计的位置实在是不敢恭维。	Look at the comments that very humanized design, I did not find where humanized, remote control this commonly used up and down, return key design position is really not complimentary.	yes
所以呢，就当个电视吧，再外加电视盒之类的用吧。	So, let's use it as a TV, plus a TV box or something like that.	yes
降价太厉害了	The price reduction is too great.	yes
降价太厉害了，一百多入现在99！	The price reduction is too strong, more than 100 are now 99!	yes
在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	I have accumulated a lot of unevaluated orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the evaluation content.	yes
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I use this paragraph to evaluate, it means that this product has at least 85 points or more.	yes
而比较差的产品，我绝对不会偷懒到复制粘贴评价，这样其他消费者在购买的时候会作为参考，而商家也会因此改进商品质量。	For poorer products, I will never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers will use them as a reference when buying, and merchants will therefore improve the quality of the goods.	yes
低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	Low price and good line, this is enough if you don't have a fever.	yes
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	Such a cheap line, but it should be up to the hdmi certification standard, personally compared to the domestic Akihabara these bullshit things ( the price is twice as expensive), the line body is strong, but also relatively soft, 7 meters transmission without noise, after the low-priced line identified times and times think about the low-priced line in the future.	yes
东西还可以，但是亚马逊的售后服务真的比其他网站差太多了	Things are OK, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.	yes
下单后发现下错了，但是取消订单已经取消不了，网页联系在线客服一直显示错误链接，联系不上。	After placing the order, I found that the order was placed incorrectly, but the cancellation of the order cannot be cancelled. The wrong link has been displayed on the webpage to contact the online customer service. I can't get in touch with it.	yes
到货后送货员给我打电话，我说我不要了，想取消订单的没取消成功，派送员就拿回去了，说先给我签收上，让我申请退货。	After the goods arrived, the delivery man called me. I said I didn't want it anymore. If I wanted to cancel the order, I didn't cancel it successfully. The delivery man took it back and said to sign for it first and let me apply for a return.	yes
申请退货时才告知食品类一旦签收不能退货，没办法打电话给亚马逊客服，也是一样说法，签收不能退货。	When applying for a return, I told the food category that once I signed for it, I couldn't return it. I couldn't call Amazon customer service. The same is true. I signed for it and couldn't return it.	yes
我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I have bought items that cannot be returned under the policy in Jingdong and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc., and contacted customer service to return them. Moreover, after Jingdong's diapers were opened, the smell was too big. Contact customer service to return them. If you don't get to Amazon, you won't be able to return them.	yes
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it.	yes
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	Tell me that either I accept it myself or let the delivery man buy it himself. It is not easy for the delivery man to send him. Why should I let him pay for something that he didn't buy himself? It's not what he bought.	yes
行，我也不退了，我自己收下了，但是必须给你们的服务打1分	OK, I won't return it either. I'll take it myself, but I have to give your service 1 point.	yes
劝大家不要白花钱	Advise everyone not to spend money in vain.	yes
首先满怀期待购买，觉得都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧，收到了以后看包装觉得还可以，个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感，吃到嘴里完全没有味道，寡淡无味，咬开来果肉一圈是暗黄色就是坏了那种，好坏参着卖的，能吃的也就不到三分之一，劝大家不要买，也不便宜，质量太差了！	First of all, I am looking forward to buying it. I think the Dole brand should not be so bad. After receiving it, I think the packaging is OK and the size is not bad, but there is a box that is basically soft. It cannot be seen from the outside. I want to feel it. There is no taste at all in my mouth. It is faint and tasteless. If you bite open the pulp, it is dark yellow or it is broken. If you sell it with good or bad reference, you can eat less than one-third of it. I advise everyone not to buy it, and it is not cheap. The quality is too cheap.	yes
吃一堑长一智，以后再也不在电商买水果了！	Eat a pit and gain wisdom, and never buy fruit in e-commerce again in the future.	yes
产品防伪标识在哪里	Where is the product anti-counterfeiting label?	yes
瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的，从外包装袋看，感觉蹂躏的程度让人揪心，毕竟是食物类的包装太简单了，而且还是属于国际购的，还有没看到什么明显的防伪标识标志，开瓶非常轻松，关键是盖内的一层蜂蜜直接从里面冒出来了，有开口几乎是没有什么粘连性，外国产品都是这样的吗？	The sharp dent in the bottom corner of the bottle should have been caused by a strong impact. From the outer packaging bag, the degree of ravage is worrying. After all, the food packaging is too simple, and it is still internationally purchased. I haven't seen any obvious anti-counterfeiting signs. It is very easy to open the bottle. The key is that a layer of honey in the lid comes out directly from inside. There is almost no adhesion when there is an opening. Are all foreign products like this?	yes
生在中国的我有点不理解了。	Born in China, I don't understand a little bit.	yes
应该是正品吧？	It should be authentic, right?	yes
还有拍下时提示二十几号到，这个是14号收到的，我第一次在这里海外购，只是把自己的疑惑写下来，或许这都是正常的？	And when I took the picture, I was prompted to arrive on the 20th. This was received on the 14th. I bought it overseas for the first time here. I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe this is all normal.	yes
提货服务有待改进	Delivery service needs to be improved.	yes
我一共买了5份提货券，在提取时，第一次预约提取3份，结果只寄过来2份，经过多方沟通才确认是漏发、答应后需补发；第二次预约，刚好赶上休息日，网站和微信均无提示需要在工作日预约，造成了不必要的恐慌，建议以后改善。	I bought a total of 5 delivery vouchers. When I was picking up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 vouchers for the first time, but only 2 vouchers were sent to me. After communication with many parties, it was confirmed that it was a missed voucher. After agreeing, it needed to be reissued. The second appointment, just in time for the rest day, the website and WeChat are not prompted to make an appointment on a working day, causing unnecessary panic. It is recommended to improve in the future.	yes
不错的购物	Nice shopping.	yes
东西好评！	Things are well received.	yes
还是比较相信亚马逊自营的东西，现在海外购以后很方便，从国外买回来物流时间比国内也就多几天，不得不说亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的，比走转运要快很多，所以现在很多东西都在海外购上买。	I still believe in Amazon's self-operated things. Now it is very convenient to buy them overseas. The logistics time to buy them back from abroad is only a few days longer than in China. I have to say that Amazon's customs clearance ability to buy them overseas is still very strong, which is much faster than transshipment. So now a lot of things are bought overseas on buying them. It is much faster than buying them overseas now.	yes
希望国内商品的质量和价格能够更好一些，很多东西都是国内产的，但是出去转一圈买回来比在国内还便宜，希望改进。	I hope the quality and price of domestic goods can be better. Many things are domestically produced, but it is cheaper to go out and buy them back than in China. I hope to improve.	yes
垃圾	Garbage.	yes
看到这样的包裹，试问大家:觉不觉得是路边的垃圾?	Seeing such a package, I would like to ask everyone: I don't think it's roadside garbage.	yes
一个塑料易碎的包装，就用一个塑料袋从所谓的德国发过来，这样的包装是负责的吗?	A plastic fragile package is sent from the so-called Germany in a plastic bag. Is such a package responsible?	yes
我看这样的包装是装垃圾一样的，购买这个产品，包装及其简陋，没有任何防止破损的措施，就一个简单的塑料袋包装，到手后，包裹完全变形了，里面的物品也有破损。	I think this kind of packaging is the same as packing garbage. When I buy this product, the packaging is extremely simple and there are no measures to prevent damage. I just pack it in a simple plastic bag. After I get it, the package is completely deformed. The items inside are also damaged.	yes
如果我只是碰到一个这样的，我认了，买了几个都是这样子，找亚马逊客服，客服就说可以退，但运费垫付，然后运费以礼品卡的形式返回给我。	If I just come across one like this, I accept it, and I bought a few like this. I ask Amazon customer service, and the customer service says it can be refunded, but the freight is paid in advance, and then the freight is returned to me in the form of a gift card.	yes
我试问一下，我用现金支付运费，你们给我返礼品卡，这是要我自己买你们礼品卡就直说啊，还要自己把产品邮寄到德国仓库，这不是买个产品受罪啊!	Let me ask, I pay the freight in cash, and you give me a gift card back. This means that I want to buy your gift card by myself, and I have to mail the product to the German warehouse by myself. This is not about buying a product to suffer from the crime.	yes
而我一直跟客服说，出现这样的问题是谁的责任，客服却半句不说是他们的责任，连半句责任都不敢担当，这样的售后服务还有什么保障呢? 一句话:认栽!但我估计我这个评价，亚马逊都不会给公布的机会，直接回删除!	And I have been telling the customer service that who is responsible for such a problem, but the customer service does not say a word that it is their responsibility, and they dare not even take responsibility for half a sentence. What guarantee is there for such after-sales service? Bottom line: admit defeat. But I estimate that Amazon will not give me the opportunity to publish this review, directly back to delete.	yes
质量很好5星，物流很差	The quality is very good 5 stars, and the logistics is poor.	yes
1，质量很好，秒杀的，价格适中，物超所值。	1. The quality is very good, it is a flash sale, the price is moderate, and it is worth the money.	yes
2，结实、用料足、焊点牢固、表面处理得当、颜色很好。	2. Strong, sufficient material, firm solder joints, proper surface treatment, and good color.	yes
3，物流是硬伤，3号下的单，11号到的。	3. Logistics is a flaw. The order placed on the 3rd arrived on the 11th.	yes
4，如果亚马逊没有标注预计到货时间是2月7号，我或许会很满意。	4. If Amazon did not indicate that the expected arrival time is February 7th, I may be very satisfied.	yes
5，但标注了预期到货时间，就相当于给用户一个承诺，当承诺无法兑现的时候，用户很难受。	5, but marking the expected arrival time is equivalent to giving the user a promise. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user is very uncomfortable.	yes
6，如果你没有给予承诺的把握，请不要做出承诺。	6. If you are not sure of making a promise, please do not make a promise.	yes
7，实际上，我非常在意商家做出的承诺。	7. In fact, I am very concerned about the promises made by the merchants.	yes
8，所以，我打了低分。	8, so I scored low.	yes
金线会掉色	The gold thread will fade.	yes
效果还是有的，但感觉是否明显，就看个人咯，或是心理作用。	The effect is still there, but whether the feeling is obvious depends on the individual, or the psychological effect.	yes
有一点不太好的，就是金色的线，本来设计出来是觉得好看，但实际上，这个金线会掉色，往车上一放，如果拿动几次，手上，和车上，会有一些金粉。	One thing that is not very good is the gold thread. It was originally designed to look good, but in fact, the gold thread will fade and be placed on the car. If you hold it a few times, there will be some gold dust on your hands and on the car. Some gold dust on the hand and on the car.	yes
希望产品可以改进。	I hope the product can be improved.	yes
这种方形的，也没啥装饰效果，就不要搞金线上去，掉下来在车上弄脏车还麻烦。	This square, there is no decorative effect, do not engage in gold thread on it, fall off in the car dirty car is also troublesome.	yes
东西完好，速度可以，分2个包裹还不同包装	The items are in good condition and the speed is OK. They are divided into 2 packages and packaged differently.	yes
8天的速度蛮快的，但就是2件分了2个包裹，包装还不一样，明显一个防震太多了，厚纸板贴着，封了层塑料，外包装也方便拆，一个就国内的快递盒似的，放了几个缓冲气囊就算事了，感觉有点敷衍。	The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it is 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, the packaging is not the same, obviously a shock too much, thick cardboard attached, sealed layer of plastic, the outer packaging is also easy to dismantle, one is like a domestic express box, put a few buffer airbags even if it is a matter, feel a little perfunctory, feel a little perfunctory, a little perfunctory, a little perfunctory, a little too shockproof, thick cardboard attached, sealed layer of plastic, the outer packaging is also convenient to dismantle, a little like a domestic express box, put a few buffer airbags, feel a little perfunctory, a little perfunctory, a little perfunctory, feel a little perfunctory, a little perfun	yes

并不是自营商品，亚马逊无耻了	It's not a self-operated product. Amazon is shameless and shameless.	yes
页面明确标注自营，实际上由供应商配送，售后由供应商负责，出问题自行联系供货商。	The page is clearly marked as self-operated. In fact, it is delivered by the supplier. After-sales is the responsibility of the supplier. If there is a problem, contact the supplier yourself.	yes
想取消订单，对不起，订单信息已传递给供应商，不能取消；想退换货，在亚马逊成功申请了退换货，对不起，没有人理你，需要自行联系供货商退货。	Want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, can not cancel. If you want to return or exchange goods, you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon. Sorry, no one cares about you. You need to contact the supplier to return the goods by yourself.	yes
这尼玛哪门子自营商品。	What kind of self-operated product is this Nima?	yes
商品不是亚马逊配送，售后亚马逊不承担，客服竟然说“我帮你联系供应商”，还声称就是自营，太无耻了，赤裸裸的不要脸，赤裸裸的对消费者进行欺诈！	Goods are not Amazon delivery, after-sales Amazon does not bear, customer service actually said "I help you contact the supplier", but also claimed to be self-operated, too shameless, naked shameless, naked fraud to consumers.	yes
郁闷的体验	A gloomy experience.	yes
之前在别家网购的滤芯，过滤效果不错，28天结束之后再用多一两天也一样没有水垢。	The filter element purchased online from another store before has a good filtering effect, and there is no scale after one or two more days after the end of 28 days.	yes
由于一直以来在亚马逊购置的东西品质都可以，这次就想着在这边买，第一次在亚马逊买滤芯，感觉不太好，不但早早就开始有水垢，而且滤芯一直用到第28天，都会有悬浮的小黑碳粉，真不知道是继续用下去，还是直接扔了好，非常郁闷~	Since the quality of the things purchased on Amazon all the time can be, this time I think about buying here, the first time I buy a filter element on Amazon, I don't feel very good, not only began to have scale early, but also the filter element has been used until the 28th day, there will be suspended small black toner, I really don't know whether to continue to use it, or just throw it away. It's very depressing ~ very depressing~ to throw it away.	yes
没有想象的那么好	Not as good as expected.	yes
和我以往用过的插线板比较，外部做工一般，内部如何未拆开看，但愿如店家所描述，从使用方便性上看，每一独立单位是否通电缺少显示	Compared with the plugboards I have used in the past, the external workmanship is average, and the interior is not disassembled. I hope that as described by the store, from the perspective of ease of use, there is a lack of display on whether each independent unit is powered on or not.	yes
包装破损了，等时间来检验产品的质量。	The packaging is damaged. Wait for time to check the quality of the product.	yes

总体不错，有点小问题	Overall good, a little problem.	yes
第一次购买滤水壶，看了几篇评价文章，感觉LAICA的性价比高些就选择了这个，收到货按说明书装好了滤芯，试用了一下，感觉总体不错，但是在倒水的时候好像原水会从壶嘴的地方与处理后的水混合（原水仓密封不太严）。	The first time I bought a water filter kettle, I read several evaluation articles and felt that LAICA was more cost-effective, so I chose this one. I received the goods and installed the filter element according to the instructions. I tried it, and it felt good overall, but when pouring water, it seemed that the raw water would mix with the treated water from the spout ( the raw water tank was not tightly sealed) .	yes
用的时候一定要等所有水过滤完再倒出！	When using it, be sure to wait until all the water is filtered before pouring it out.	yes
图片不完整	The picture is incomplete.	yes
图片没有拍出侧面的细节，侧面的细节跟主体的风格并不一致，有很大差别，这是其一；这个珠子是泰国产的，没有标明产地，这是其二；没有标明质地，这是其三；我在英国买的时候，分明每项各有盒子，这里只有一个简简单单的塑料袋，而且珠子上面没有任何的产品标志，我哪里判断得出是真是假。	The picture does not show the details of the side, the details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body, there is a big difference, this is one of them. This bead is made in Thailand, and there is no indication of origin. This is the second place. No indication of texture, this is the three. When I bought it in the UK, it was clear that there were boxes for each item, there was only a simple plastic bag, and there was no product logo on the beads, and I couldn't tell if it was real or fake. How could I tell whether it was real or not?	yes

6对我来说我只能继续等待...	For me, I can only continue to wait.	yes
底不平	The bottom is uneven.	yes
因为看点评里说的都很好，所有对这款锅很有期待，拿到手的时候也很喜欢，很轻巧，但开锅的时候就发现问题了，锅底不是平的，中间突起来，周边凹下去，油都跑到周边了，特意买来的开锅大肥肉炸出好多油都没法覆盖中央区域，糊了，开锅都开不了，这样的构造估计没法正常煮菜。	Because the comments are very good, all of them are looking forward to this pot, and they like it very much when they get it, which is very lightweight, but when they boil the pot, they find the problem. The bottom of the pot is not flat, the middle protrudes, the periphery is concave, and the oil runs to the periphery. The specially bought large fat meat in the pot is fried so much oil that it can't cover the central area. It is pastey, and the pot can't be boiled. It is estimated that such a structure cannot cook normally. It is estimated that such a structure cannot cook normally.	yes
不知道是否我运气不好，刚好拿到个底子不平的锅，幸亏亚马逊提供一个月的退货服务，果断退了。	I don't know if I was unlucky enough to get a pot with an uneven foundation. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I returned it decisively.	yes

看来美的的产品经理还没有能力去打造这样的水准的产品。	It seems that Midea's product managers are not yet capable of creating such a level of product.	no
（对于售后小姐的回馈当然不能要求太高，但当我听到售后说道这款产品所有的个体都是这样的，不是只有我买的这件有问题时，她的不以为然和如实重负的情绪让我明白对美的也不能要求太高） 2019-7-7水泵故障出水量少，已经第二次维修，第一次维修后两周又坏了。	( Of course, I can't ask too much for the after-sales lady's feedback, but when I heard the after-sales lady say that all individuals of this product are like this, not only the one I bought has a problem, her disapproval and truthful heavy burden made me understand that I can't ask too much for beauty.)

经过一个晚上空调房依然能保持很高的温度。	The air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature after a night.	yes
亚马逊说周年活动320大优惠，后来发现大家249,289,299都有，瞬间有种被欺骗感，但是去超市对比了一下依然比同价位各种杂牌划算多了，今后外出可随车携带。	Amazon said that the anniversary event 320 big discounts, and later found that everyone 249, 289, 299 have, an instant feeling of being cheated, but to go to the supermarket compared it is still much more cost-effective than all kinds of miscellaneous brands at the same price. You can carry it with you when you go out in the future.	yes

机器看着挺新，配件齐全，就是杯子放在底座上晃动的厉害，我都害怕开机杯子直接飞出去！	The machine looks quite new and has complete accessories, but the cup shakes so badly on the base that I am afraid that the boot cup will fly out directly.	yes
问了一个有5200的朋友，听他描述好像没有我的这个这么松。	I asked a friend who has 5200, and it seems that his description is not as loose as mine.	yes

多少次一看到三星这个手机，脑海就想起她，那种痛苦就随之而来灌满全身，我从没舍得用过超过2千元的手机，可是买给她的时候，却毫不犹豫，对一个人再好，可是有天当她变心了，所有的山盟海誓也就烟消云散了。	How many times when I see Samsung mobile phone, I think of her in my mind, and the pain fills my whole body. I have never been willing to use a mobile phone worth more than 2, 000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I did not hesitate.

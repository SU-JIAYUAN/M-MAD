.a 归档库文件(Archive file)	.a File record (Document record)	no
除非使用了 -cec，-s, 或 -E 选项(或者编译错误阻止了完整的过程),否则连接总是最后的步骤.	Within the nonattendance of the -cec, -s, or -E choices, connecting is continuously the final step (or compilation blunders avoid the total prepare).	no
在连接阶段中,所有对应于源程序的.e 文件，-1 库文件, 无法识别的文件名(包括指定的.o H 标文件和 .a 库文件)按命令行中的顺序传递给连接器选项 (OPTIONS)	All source program.e records, -1 library records, and obscure record names (counting specified.o H standard records and.a library records) are conveyed to the linker within the association stage within the arrange indicated by the command line alternatives (Choices)	no
选项必须分立给出 : de ' 完全不同于 `-d -r '.	Parameters must be indicated separately since "de" and "-d -r" are totally diverse.	no
大多数 ` -=E :和 `-W' 选项有两个相反的格式 : -fname 和 -fno-name (或 -Wname 和 -Wno- name).	The larger part of "-=E:" and "-W" choices have two polar alternate extremes: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).	no

If only a portion of the four stages (Preprocess, Compile, Compile, Connect) is operated, the ` -x' option (or Ah after the filename) can be used to tell geo where to start, and the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (e.g., `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or compile source files, ETER. In the absence of ERA ATI, GCC is used by `.o' to replace the source file name with the post-level `.ec filename. Other options can be used to choose the name.	yes
了的目标文件.	The target file.	yes
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	After compilation, it stops and does not proceed to assembly.	yes
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	During the compilation process, pipelines are used instead of temporary files, as the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from pipelines. This is not a problem for GNU's assembler, which can accept a C "dialect" that supports ANSI standard C programs.	yes
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This will close some features in GNU Cc that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, as well as rarely used ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, and despite the use of all standard libraries available in the hosted environment (note: in the hosted environment, the main function returns an int value, a typical example is almost all programs except the kernel. In the corresponding freestanding environment, there is no standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website).	yes
对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	Treat work statements that do not have parameters, like "int foo ();," within the C way, which implies you shouldn't indicate the number or kind of parameters. (C++ as it were) .	no
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	In C++, a function like foo often indicates that the argument is empty.	no
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	Here, segment postings have been trimmed in an exertion to suit a few highlights of customary C compilers.	no
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	Subtle elements can be found within the NU c handbook; we evacuated them so that perusers wouldn't HERI when the data was not pertinent.	no
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	With one exception: the “-traditional” option has the unintended side effect of enabling assignment to this for C++ applications (but not C).	no
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	It has the same impact as the "-Ethis-is-variable" alternative.	no
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp bolsters a number of highlights of the customary Cc preprocessor.	no
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	Especially, the preprocessor demonstrated over, but not the other results of the "-conventional" alternative.	no
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	-fdollars-in-identifiers “$” characters are allowed in identifiers (as it were in C++).	no
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	The "-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers" alternative can be utilized to particularly cripple the "$" character.	no
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	(On a few target frameworks, GNU C++ licenses the “$” character by default, but not all.)	no
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	-fenum-int-equiv (MEF C++) Allow verifiable change of subterranean insect sorts to identification sorts.	no

-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	-fexternal—templates Decrease the estimate of format affirmations (as it were in C++) by replicating each layout work as it were where it is characterized.	no
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	For this choice to work, all template-using records must be checked with "#pragma implementatio" (definition) or "#Pragma interface" (announcement).	no
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	Format instantiations are all outside sorts when a program is compiled with the alternative "-fexternal-templates". The execution file's essential occurrences must be made to seem.	no
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	With typedefs, which make reference to each required occasion, this is often conceivable.	no
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	Hence, all format occasions are expressly indicated as built-ins when compiling with the default "-fno-exteznal-templates" choice.	no
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All part capacities are dealt with as virtual capacities of the encasing lesson, with the exemption of constructor capacities and the mnew and erase part administrators.	no
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	Not each call to a part work will essentially go through the inside vtable as a result of this.	no
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	A virtual work may once in a while be able to be called specifically in case the compiler decides it can; in this case, it'll be.	no
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch Acknowledge a sort jumble between the condition expression's moment and third contentions.	no
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	Such an expression incorporates a esteem of Void. Task to typically permitted (as it were in C++) utilizing the hail -fthis—is-variable.	no
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	Assignable "this" got to be out of date when user-defined free capacity administration was included to C++.	no
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	Task to this interior a course part work is in this way by default a lawful operation.	no
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	With the “-fthis-is-variable” choice, you'll permit this in spite of the fact that for in reverse compatibility.	no
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	-funsigned-char Characterize char as a sort that's unsigned, comparable to unsigned char.	no
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Each machine features a one of a kind default char sort. It may well be either marked or unsigned char.	no
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	When depending on the signedness of the information, a convenient program ought to continuously utilize marked char or unsigned chaz.	no
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	However, a part of apps as it were back plain char and anticipate this to be marked (or unsigned, depending on the machine the program is composed for).	no
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This choice and its inverse constrain the identical default behavior for that program.	no
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	Indeed in spite of the fact that a char carries on absolutely like one of them, its sort ought to continuously be explicitly expressed as either a marked char or an unsigned char.	no
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	These alternatives are utilized to characterize marked or unsigned bitfields in case no “signed” or “unsigned” modifiers are explicitly given.	no
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	In spite of the fact that the basic numbers sorts they infer from, like int, are marked, bitfields are marked by default; be that as it may, in the event that the “-traditional” alternative is provided, bitfields are continuously unsigned.	no
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	String constants are not given uncommon treatment by -fwritable-strings; instep, they are put away within the writable information fragment.	no
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	Typically done to guarantee compatibility with more seasoned applications that do not think it's a great thought to alter string constants, the same result is accomplished utilizing the “-traditional” choice.	no

欧盟峰会为难民政策争吵不休，欧盟官员：接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈	EU summit squabbles over refugee policy, EU official: bottlenecks at every step of reception process	yes
【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	[Global Times Special Correspondent Niu Ruifei in Belgium] According to Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit that day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration, which makes it easier to deport illegal immigrants.	yes
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	The move by the EU was reportedly a response to the growing concern over illegal immigration in Europe, with the core issue now being that very few illegal immigrants can ultimately be deported.	yes
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funds" to strengthen external borders, including through infrastructure and surveillance.	yes
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	Yet, the EU and member states have clashed over matters including how to pay for the fence.	yes
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	Von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not cover the costs.	yes
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	But diplomats from some member states say that if the EU could share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external border, it would free up national budgets and thus speed up the construction process.	yes
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	The European website Euractiv reported that EU officials admitted that there were bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, and the limited reception capacity and overburdened immigration authorities of member states could not prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in EU countries, leaving the EU's refugee reception system in a near "permanent crisis".	yes
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	According to estimates from the European Commission, the Schengen member states of the EU received more than 920,000 asylum claims in 2017—a nearly 50% rise from the year before.	yes
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	Almost 330,000 illicit entry were noted by the European Union last year.	no
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	In light of this, the summit also adopted the "principle" that member states of the EU may remove unlawful immigrants in accordance with a court ruling in another member state.	no
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	The article also stated that EU leaders decided to "expand the use of the notion of a safe state," which will allow the EU to create a standard list.	no

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	The United States escalates its "chip war" and hits the global semiconductor industry hard-Chinanews.com	yes
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	Recently, the US "chip war" against China has shown signs of escalating - first, under US pressure, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; then foreign media reported that the US government is considering severing all ties between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order restricting US investment in China's sensitive technology industries... Shortly after the start of 2023, the US has been relentless in its efforts to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.	yes
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	In recent years, the US has never ceased its efforts to suppress China's "core" development, precisely suppressing the supply chain of China's semiconductor industry on one hand, and building a "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain alliance on the other, aiming to completely "shake off" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.	yes
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it's wooing South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or establishing a chip "quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, China, or establishing a semiconductor industry chain "small circle" through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia "quadrilateral mechanism" and "Indo-Pacific economic framework", the US is attempting to build a closed supply chain cycle dominated by the US by introducing politicized, camp-based, and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry, thereby making up for its shortcomings in chip manufacturing and maintaining its advantageous position in the global chip industry.	yes
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	However, the US's high-profile "chip tactics" against China also resulted in a "lose-lose" situation.	yes
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	Recently, Lam Research, a well-known US chip manufacturing equipment supplier, announced that it will lay off 1,300 full-time employees due to the latest round of the ban on the export of chip manufacturing equipment to China, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.	yes
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	The global lithography giant, ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands, recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to an increase in semiconductor prices.	yes
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	According to US media analysis, after the US government brutally suppressed China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies have been deeply affected, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, etc.	yes
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	The so-called US suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.	yes
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a high-technology and knowledge-intensive industry that has long formed a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain.	yes
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	Using specialized division of labor, experts estimate that the complete production process for semiconductor devices requires crossing international borders more than 70 times and takes 100 days.	no
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Although the US semiconductor sector has a solid base, its manufacturing capabilities, particularly in terms of modern manufacturing techniques, are relatively limited, and it mainly depends on East Asia.	no
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	It is difficult to modify the geographical distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries, even when the United States makes every effort to direct advanced chip production and the supply chain to the regional development of the "little circle" led by the United States.	no
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The worldwide semiconductor industry has been seriously harmed by the United States' aggressive "reshaping" and "de-Sinicization" of the semiconductor industry chain.	no
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	The foundation of the global future industry is the chip, and the growth of the chip industry depends on the involvement of all nations in the globe.	no
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	The US passed 3 acts to reinforce its tech advantage: "Innovation and Competition Act," "American Competition Act of 2022," and "Chips and Science Act", It made chip manufacturers establish factories in the US and promoted US leadership in the industry.	no
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	The United States has temporarily hampered the growth of China's semiconductor industry and associated sectors while also reaping substantial rewards.	no
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	However, in the long run, the hysterical suppression by the US has forced China's chip industry to make constant advancements, depriving itself of the massive Chinese market, which will eventually greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of US technology companies and harm the growth of the global chip industry.	no

健身行业应摆脱信任危机-中新网	The fitness industry should be free of the crisis of trust - China News Network	yes
又一大型健身房“暴雷”？	Another big gym "storm"?	yes
近日，知名健身机构中健健身会员维权问题引起社会关注。	Recently, the issue of protecting the rights of healthy members in well-known fitness facilities has attracted social attention.	yes
春节后不少会员发现自己所在门店没有正常营业，随后，关于该机构倒闭跑路的传闻引起会员恐慌，导致公安、人社部门介入。	Many of the members found that their stores did not operate normally after the Spring Festival, and rumors about the closure of the agency caused panic among the members, which led to the intervention of the public security and human society departments.	yes
最后，该机构相关负责人出面回应，承诺会努力保障好员工和会员的合法权益，风波才得以平息。	In the end, the relevant person in charge of the organization came forward to respond, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the turmoil subsided.	yes
个别健身机构的部分门店出现经营问题，暂时关闭，消费者本可心平气和等待问题解决，为何不少会员的第一反应是“大事不妙”？	Why is it that when individual fitness institutions temporarily close some of their branches due to operational issues, instead of calmly waiting for the problem to be resolved, many members' first reaction is "something is seriously wrong"?	yes
健身俱乐部会员维权风波背后，是行业信任危机的深层次问题。	Behind the turmoil of fitness club members' rights protection is the deep-seated problem of the industry's trust crisis.	yes
国内传统健身房普遍采取预付费模式，“赚用户不来的钱”是其发展的底层逻辑。	Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt the prepaid model, "earning money that users do not come" is the underlying logic of its development.	yes
通过预售会员卡获取现金流，不断开新店，看似能够循环往复，实则寅吃卯粮，无法形成稳定的盈利模式。	By obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and continuously opening new stores, it seems like a cycle that can be repeated. However, it's actually robbing Peter to pay Paul, and cannot form a stable profit model.	yes
健身房跑路等行业负面信息频频传出，对消费者信心造成强烈冲击。	Negative information in industries such as gym running away frequently spreads, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.	yes
从市场前景看，健身房当然算得上是一门有“钱途”的好生意。	Of course, gyms might be seen as a good business with "money potential" from the perspective of market prospects.	no
健身赛道虽然起起伏伏，但始终受到资本关注。	The fitness track has had its ups and downs, but capital has always been interested in it.	no
多项数据显示，文体消费等领域热度不断攀升，市场持续回暖。	Many statistics demonstrate that the market is still growing and that consumption in the arts, sports, and other professions is becoming more and more popular.	no
具体到健身市场，随着居民生活水平稳步提高，健康生活理念深入人心，健身行业发展大有可为。	With regard to the fitness market, there is a lot of room for growth given the steadily rising living standards of locals and the widespread acceptance of the value of a healthy lifestyle.	no
形势越是趋好，行业越需重视发展质量。	The requirement for the industry to focus on development quality increases as the situation improves.	no
然而，个别机构对消费复苏后的健身市场盲目乐观，刚从危机中走出来，又吹响开疆拓土的号角，把融资资金一股脑投入新店建设上。	Despite consumption recovery, some institutions were overly optimistic about the fitness market and invested all financing funds in new store construction. 5x5	no
不可否认，这几年受疫情影响，不少机构退出，行业重新洗牌，有实力的企业此时选择性地加大收购力度、重新布局，未尝不是新机遇。	The epidemic led to institutions withdrawing and business restructuring, big firms are restructuring and acquiring selectively, not a new opportunity.	no
但是，健身市场发展要想进入良性循环，迈上行稳致远的康庄大道，行业就必须改变传统模式，改变经营策略。	But, the sector must alter the conventional model and its business strategy if it hopes to enter a positive feedback loop and follow a steady and long-term course.	no
只有稳扎稳打，重新建立起消费者的信任度、安全感，才能真正赢得市场、赢得未来。	We can only genuinely win the market and the future by working consistently and regaining the confidence and security of consumers.	no
相比大建新店抢占市场，健身行业当前更需要的是沉下心来优化服务，用高质量发展来稳住用户。	The fitness business needs to settle down to maximize services and stabilize users with high-quality development, as opposed to opening additional locations to capture the market.	no
首先，要靠服务留住用户。	To keep users, it is first vital to rely on services.	no
健身房属于服务行业，其本质是坚持“用户导向”，要紧紧围绕用户需求，把经营重心放在服务提质升级上。	The essence of the service sector, which includes the gyms, is to uphold "user orientation," pay special attention to customer needs, and improve service quality.	no
其次，要靠数字化转型提升用户体验。	To enhance user experience, second, rely on digital transformation.	no
比如当下流行的互联网健身房模式，实现用户按次付费和场地自选。	For instance, the current and widely used Internet gym model allows consumers to pay per view and select their own locations.	no
同时，身体数据、运动数据得以有效利用，还可以满足社交需求，实现从线上到线下完整的服务闭环。	Body data and sports data can be used to address societal demands and create a seamless closed-loop service from online to offline at the same time.	no
没有私教推销，没有巨额年卡，用户对健身机构“跑路”的担忧降低了，信任感也就提升了。	Users are less concerned about "running away" from exercise facilities because there is no personal training promotion and no large annual card, and their sense of trust has also increased.	no
另外，还要积极探索多元业态。	Also, we need to actively investigate other business forms.	no
如今，体育消费已经从单一服务走向场景消费，健身俱乐部有望成为消费新入口，围绕健身所需的运动补给和健身器械等周边产品或将成为新的盈利点，为消费者提供更丰富选择。	Nowadays, watching sports is more like watching a scenario than just one service, fitness centers are anticipated to emerge as new points of access for consumers, sports gear and fitness equipment are examples of peripheral goods that could develop into new profit centers and give consumers more options.	no

Q：请问重阳投资，如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势？	Q: How do you view the US non-farm payroll data for January and the outlook for investment?	yes
A：2月3日美国劳工部公布2023年1月非农就业数据，新增非农就业51.7万人，大幅高于市场预期的18.9万人；失业率降至3.4%，为近50年以来的最低位；时薪同比增速4.4%，环比增速0.3%，略有放缓。	A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor released non-farm payrolls data for January 2023, adding 517,000 new non-farm payrolls, significantly higher than market expectations of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years; hourly wages grew 4.4% year on year and 0.3% month on month, a slight slowdown.	yes
从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	In terms of overall figures, this data may be influenced by several one-time and technical factors, such as the return of striking teachers to work, revisions in survey statistical methods, and updates in seasonal adjustment factors. There could be subsequent revisions to the data (as seen in January 2022 when the initial figure of 504,000 new non-farm jobs was later revised down to 364,000 jobs). Therefore, the non-farm employment situation may not be as robust as the data initially suggests.	yes
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	Structurally, the impact of job cuts in high-tech firms is still present, but relatively low; new jobs in high-touch services, such as leisure hotels and education and health care, have rebounded sharply, and data suggest that the service labor gap remains.	yes
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Combined with the rebound in service industry PMI, job vacancies, and labor gap data, which also exceeded expectations, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has ushered in a quick recovery after extreme weather and holidays.	yes
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	We believe that it is difficult to improve the tension between supply and demand in the US job market without going through a recession.	yes
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	Currently, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 years old is already close to the pre-pandemic peak.	yes
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	In addition, due to the strength of excess savings of American residents and consumer credit, strong consumer demand will further lag the impact of tightening policies on the job market.	yes
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	The ongoing tightness in the US job market's supply and demand will be a prevailing characteristic of the US economy in 2023.	yes
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	Considering the impending end of interest rate hikes and the continuous fluctuations in inflation expectations, we are not optimistic about the sustained decline in wage growth.	no
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Prior to the release of this data, the US stock, bond, and currency markets had overly optimistic expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's path of interest rate hikes.	no
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	As inflation data continues to improve, the Fed has continued to maintain the fragile balance of market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of rate hikes, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statements, expecting not only an early halt to rate hikes, but also two year-end rate cuts.	no
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	In the case of tight labor market supply and demand, the impact of tightening policy is unknown, we believe that the Fed's year-end guidance on rate hikes is relatively reasonable, the adjustment of extreme market expectations and the crowded trading may cause some harm to the market.	no
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	Nevertheless, the stubbornness of payroll growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of each CPI sub-leading indicators, since October the US CPI data has turned to a rapid decline in the phase, the stubbornness of payroll growth will only form the bottom of future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, the market may enter a new round of gaming after the next release of inflation data.	no
杉杉创始人郑永刚因突发心脏疾病过世 曾带领中国服装第一股转型 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan, passed away due to a sudden heart disease. He once led China's first listed clothing company to transform - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website	yes
经济观察网 记者 郑淯心 2月11日，认证主体为杉杉控股有限公司（以下简称“杉杉控股 ” ） 的微信公众号发布讣告，杉杉企业创始人、杉杉控股董事局主席郑永刚因突发心脏疾病救治无效，于2023年2月10日去世，享年65岁。	Economic Observation Network Reporter Zheng Huixin On February 11, the WeChat public account of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") released an obituary that Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to ineffective treatment of sudden heart disease.	yes
上世纪80年代，郑永刚担任国营棉纺厂的厂长，随着调任，1989年郑永刚成为杉杉股份的前身宁波云港服装总厂的厂长。	In the 80s of last century, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of the state-owned cotton spinning factory, and with the transfer, in 1989 Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment General Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd.	yes
2022年12月，在第二十届中国企业领袖年会暨第二十二届中国企业未来之星年会上，郑永刚在演讲中称，在上世纪90年代的中国西服市场，杉杉品牌的市占率曾高达37 % 。	In December 2022, at the 20th China Business Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Future Stars Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang stated in his speech that in the Chinese suit market of the 1990s, the market share of the Shanshan brand once reached as high as 37%.	yes
1996年杉杉股份（600884.SH）上市，成为中国服装业第一家上市公司。	In 1996, Shanshan Co., Ltd. (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's garment industry.	yes
就在服装业务如日中天时，杉杉集团却开始转型，因为郑永刚意识到 ， “ 一旦市场放开，中国品牌自然会形成一个梯队式品牌市场，杉杉西服想一直独领风骚，长期成为国人的国服的可能性不大 ” 。	Just as the clothing business was booming, the Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened up, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and the possibility of Shanshan suits always leading the trend and becoming the national dress of the Chinese people in the long term is not great."	yes
1999年，杉杉开始研究企业转型，郑永刚回忆当年 ， “ 我们来到上海，寻求到底转型做什么，专门找了很多专家学者，连续不断地开一些诸葛亮会、务虚研讨会。	In 1999, Shanshan began researching corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled, "We came to Shanghai to figure out what to do with the transformation. We specifically sought out many experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings and theoretical seminars."	yes
最后，我们设定了两个大的战略方向。	In the end, we set two major strategic directions.	yes
第一个方向是新能源新材料，另外一个是大健康有未来 ” 。	The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is "great health has a future".	yes
战略方向确定后，杉杉开始寻找合作，那时候鞍山热能院为鞍钢配套的炭素研究所在做国家863课题，科研经费不够，于是杉杉和鞍山热能院碳素研究所签署合作协议，共同推动国家863课题“中间相炭微球”项目产业化，从事负极材料的研发、生产和销售，在国内实现负极材料的商用推广。	After determining the strategic direction, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, Anshan Thermal Energy Institute, a carbon research institute supporting Ansteel, was conducting a national 863 project with insufficient research funding. Therefore, Shanshan signed a cooperation agreement with Anshan Thermal Energy Institute Carbon Research Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Intermediate Phase Carbon Microsphere" project, engage in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and promote the commercial use of negative electrode materials domestically.	yes
2001年，杉杉股份实现中间相炭微球的规模化生产，开始国产化替代，取代日本成为国内中间相炭微球主要供应商。	In 2001, Suning Corporation achieved large-scale production of intermediate phase carbon microspheres and began domestic substitution, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate phase carbon microspheres in the domestic market.	no
这是中国第一家锂离子电池负极材料生产企业，实现了锂离子电池负极材料国产化。	Indeed, this made Suning Corporation the first Chinese production enterprise for lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials, thus achieving the localization of lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials in China.	no
随着锂电池的应用迅速普及，杉杉股份的锂电池业务开始逐步发展，2007年锂电材料业务被写入了杉杉股份的主营业务，服装业务营收占比逐年减少，直至2013年，杉杉股份的锂电材料业务收入全面超过服装业务。	With the rapid popularity of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Sugo began to develop gradually and In 2007, the lithium materials business was written into the main business of Sugo, and the revenue share of the garment business decreased year by year until 2013, the revenue of the lithium materials business of Sugo fully exceeded that of the garment business.	no
2021年2月，杉杉股份成功并购LG化学偏光片业务，进军LCD偏光片市场，并成立偏光片企业杉金光电，该领域技术含量比较高，杉杉的主要的竞争对手都是世界500强，如韩国三星、日本的住友化学、日东电工。	In February 2021, Sugo successfully acquired LG Chemical's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer enterprise Sugo Gold Optoelectronics, which is a relatively high technology field, and Sugo's main competitors are the world's top 500, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, Nitto Denko.	no
郑永刚曾分享过投后管理的心得 ， “ 中国的民营企业收购国际上的一些高科技企业，成功概率比较低，为什么那些收购会失败？	Zheng Yonggang has shared his insights on post-investment management, "The probability of success of Chinese private companies acquiring some international high-tech companies is relatively low, why those acquisitions will fail?	no
因为大家都会去考虑，我花了那么多钱，我得去派人管对吧，这是通常会做的一个行为 ” ， 然而郑永刚则不同，杉杉收购成功的那一天，郑永刚就到杉金光电当众宣布，杉杉作为杉金的大股东，决定实施一企两制，除了郑永刚担任董事长，杉杉企业的人不派到杉金，采取授权经营的方式，原有的分配制度、企业文化、各项管理等模式不变。	Because everyone will go to consider, I spent so much money, I have to send people to manage, right, which is usually done an act ", however, Zheng Yonggang is different, the day of the successful acquisition of Sugo, Zheng Yonggang went to Sugo Gold Optoelectronics announced in public, Sugo as the majority shareholder of Sugo Gold, decided to implement a two-enterprise system, in addition to Zheng Yonggang as chairman, Sugo enterprise people are not sent to Sugo Gold, to adopt the way of authorized operation, the original distribution system, corporate culture, the management model remains unchanged.	no
ICC鑫椤资讯发布2022年负极数据显示，杉杉负极2022年出货量突破20万吨，同比增幅100 % ， 市场份额达16 % ， 人造石墨负极材料出货量蝉联榜首。	ICC Xinfern information released 2022 negative electrode data shows that the shipment of Sugo negative electrode in 2022 exceeded 200,000 tons, with a year-on-year increase of 100 % and a market share of 16 %, and the shipment of artificial graphite negative electrode material topped the list.	no

阿拉斯加上空被击落的 “物体”究竟是什么？	What exactly was the "object" that was shot down over Alaska?	yes
扑朔迷离，猜测纷纷	Confusion and speculation abound	yes
美国军方周五（2月10日）下午再次动用美国最先进的隐身喷气战机F-22击落了一个在美国阿拉斯加上空飞行的尚未确定身份的物体。	The US military once again used its most advanced stealth fighter jet, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska, US, on Friday afternoon (February 10).	yes
击落的地点距离阿拉斯加海岸十英里。	Ten miles off Alaska's coast, it was shot down.	yes
这是美军在不到一周的时间里第二次击落空中飞行物体。	This was the second time the United States had shot down an aerial object in less than a week.	yes
上周六，来自中国的一个间谍气球在美国领空上漂移数日后在美国南卡罗莱纳州沿岸附近上空被击毁。	Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted in US airspace for days before it was destroyed near the US coast of South Carolina.	yes
五角大楼说，第二个被击落的物体于周四晚上首次进入美国领空，在阿拉斯加东北部上空移动时被美国军方跟踪，飞行高度为1.2万米（4万英尺），其大小与一辆小型汽车差不多，与先前被击落的那个中国间谍气球相比要小很多。	The Pentagon said the second downed object entered U.S. airspace for the first time on Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 metres (40,000 ft), about the size of a small car, and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.	yes
五角大楼还认为，目前没有迹象显示，这个物体是可操纵的。	The Pentagon also considered that there was currently no indication that the object was manipulable.	yes
白宫国家安全委员会战略沟通协调员约翰·科比周五表示，虽然这个在高空飞行的物体的具体样子尚不清楚，但它“对民航飞机的安全构成了合理的威胁”。	John Kirby, coordinator of strategic communications for the White House's National Security Council, said Friday that while the exact appearance of the object flying at high altitude was unclear, it "poses a legitimate threat to the safety of civil aircraft."	yes
科比表示，这个物体与美国境内发现的那个间谍气球不同，它上面没有悬挂“有效载荷”。	Kirby stated that the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, did not have a "payload" hanging from it.	yes
科比说，“我们把它称为一个‘物体’是我们目前能够作出的最好的描述”。	"The most accurate description we can currently provide is what we refer to as a 'object'," said Bryant.	no
拜登总统在下令击落这个物体之前听取了五角大楼的建议，他作出这个决定的时候“非常谨慎”，科比补充说。	Before deciding to send the object down, President Biden followed the Pentagon's counsel, a choice he made "very carefully," according to Bryant.	no
美国官方对这个物体的描述大致可以归纳为：大小相当于一辆小汽车，没有操纵杆，没有悬挂装置，飞行高度为一万米左右。	This object's official US description can be summed up roughly as follows: The flying height is around 10,000 meters, the size is comparable to a compact automobile, there is no joystick, and there is no suspension system.	no
但这些信息还无法回答基本问题，比如这个物体究竟是什么东西，它属于哪个国家，它在执行什么任务。	However, at this time, the information does not adequately address fundamental queries such what the object is, to which nation it belongs, and what function it serves.	no
目前网上许多的分析和猜测认为，这可能又是一只中国气球。	Many analyses and conjectures on the Internet at the moment suggest that this could be another Chinese balloon.	no
它可能与入侵美国领空的那只间谍气球和在拉美上空飘动的那只中国气球一样都来自中国，它们在不同地点执行某种任务。	It might have originated in China, just like the spy balloon that violated American airspace and the Chinese balloon that flew across Latin America and carried out some sort of operation elsewhere.	no
也有人把阿拉斯加的这个“物体”与“不明飞行物”（UFO）联系在一起。	This "object" in Alaska has also been linked by some individuals to a "unidentified flying object" (UFO).	no
美国新闻周刊的报道引用美国前众议员彼得·梅杰（Peter Meijer）周五在推特上发出的推文说，“真希望这个‘不明飞行物’也是一个间谍气球，而不是一个合法的UFO”。	Former US Representative Peter Meijer tweeted on Friday, "Wish this 'UFO' was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO," according to a US Newsweek story.	no
“将外星飞船与气象气球混为一谈的讽刺意味很令人惊讶，但这不值得引发一场星际冲突，”梅杰说。	Major remarked, "although it would be ironic to mistake an extraterrestrial spacecraft for a weather balloon, it would not be worth starting an interstellar war."	no
梅杰是在科比证实阿拉斯加的这个物体被击落之后不久发出这个推文的。	The item in Alaska had been shot down, Bryant had just confirmed before Major's tweet.	no
新闻周刊说，怀疑这个物体是UFO的不止是梅杰一人。	According to Newsweek, Major was not the only person who thinks the object was a UFO.	no
田纳西共和党籍众议员蒂姆·伯切特（Tim Burchett）批评政府上个月的掩盖情报的做法，要求国家情报总监办公室 (DNI)公布有关“不明飞行物”的报告。	Rep Tim Burchett a Republican from Tennessee, condemned the administration's cover-up last month and demanded that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) disclose a report on "unidentified flying objects."	no

It was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock at the time. I asked for a replacement. The customer service said they would fix it, then I immediately saw that the product name had changed to short sleeve. It turned out that the link I had bought was removed from the shelves.	yes
接着客服通知要么保留货品补偿一定金额，要么退货。	The customer service then informed the consumer to either keep the items and get a specified amount of compensation, or return the things.	yes
这就是亚马逊的处理方式？	Does Amazon handle it in this manner?	yes
真的很难以置信，本身衣物发错并不是我的问题，作为一个消费者我要求获得我应获得的商品，并没有提出什么很夸张的要求，亚马逊却改名字，说无库存。	It's really unbelievable. The wrong clothing itself wasn't my problem. As a consumer, I asked for the products I should get, and I didn't make any exaggerated claims, but Amazon changed the name and said it was out of stock.	yes
这是我的第一个长评，希望这不是我的最后一个。	This is my first long comment, and I hope it's not my last.	yes
让人无法理解的袖子	Incomprehensible sleeves	yes
说是牛皮的，也确实比较硬，但仔细看的话，局部有很多细小的裂痕，搞不清楚是否是真皮的，另外这个衣服的袖子真是让人无法理解，通常夹克的袖子要比衣摆长一些，不过通常也就1-2厘米，这件衣服足足长了5厘米，手臂自然下垂应该在手掌虎口的位置，但这件衣服的袖子都盖过手指了。	The sleeves of the jacket are usually longer than the sleeves of the jacket, but they are usually 1-2 cm long, and the arm should naturally hang in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of the jacket are covered with fingers.	yes
买衣服容易，退货也容易。	Clothing is easy to buy and easy to return.	yes
但是要退还钱真不知何时？	But when will the money be returned?	yes
衣服做工不错，因为版型偏小，只得退货，但是退了货以后，至今一个多星期过去了，还没有收到退款？	The clothes were well made, but due to the small size, I had to return them. However, it's been over a week since I returned them and I still haven't received a refund?	yes
而且要购买者自已和那个诚信度不怎么样的全峰快递联系，这是自购亚马逊的物品以来最糟糕的一次购物！	Also, the buyer must contact Quanfeng Express, which is not very honest. This is the worst shopping since buying an Amazon item!	yes
但店家还是不错的，积极配合催促快递及时退款，但是这个全峰快递实在的工作是做的相当让人愤怒，拖拉半个月左右才退款，这种合作伙伴是要拖亚马逊的后腿的，工作效率差，没有服务意识！	But the store is still good, actively cooperating to urge the courier to refund in time, but the work of this Quanfeng Express is really infuriating, dragging on for about half a month before refunding. This kind of partner is going to drag Amazon down, with poor work efficiency and no service awareness!	yes
更适合年轻人	more suitable for young people	yes
99秒杀的。	99 Seconds.	yes

3XL，平铺腰围2尺5，拉伸最大尺寸4尺，1.79/80公斤穿着腰有点紧。	3XL, with a flat waist circumference of 2.5 feet, maximum stretch size of 4 feet, is a bit tight around the waist for someone weighing 1.79/80 kilograms.	yes
似乎腰间没有松紧带，想加松点腰围还挺困难。	It seems there is no elastic waistband, so it's quite difficult to loosen the waist.	yes
另外，贴身穿是不舒服的。	In addition, wearing it so close to your body is uncomfortable.	yes
很好 颜色不是很鲜艳	Very good, the color is not very bright.	yes
刚买就涨了两百多，这是什么情况。	I just bought it and it went up by more than 200. That's what's going on.	yes
第一次亚马逊用的合作的天天烂快递，第一次送货没在家，后来主动和快递员约了两次送货时间，那个快递员都不送，后来直接给我退货了，这个该死的快递员一点诚信也没有，强烈建议不要再用那个天天烂快递了。	This was the first time Amazon used the cooperative courier service, Tian Tian Express, which was terrible. The first time they attempted delivery, I wasn't home. I then proactively arranged two delivery times with the courier, but they didn't deliver either time and eventually returned my package. This damn courier has no integrity at all. I strongly suggest not using Tian Tian Express anymore.	yes
这一次还有一件体恤衫也给我退货了，再拍也涨价了一百多元。	This time, a t-shirt was also returned to me, and if I were to buy it again, the price has increased by more than a hundred yuan.	yes
亚马逊自营不应该出现这样商品	Such products should not appear on Amazon's self-operated platform.	yes
产品特价的时候购买，价格不低，看评论也是很不错的产品。	The product was purchased on sale, the price was not low, and the reviews also indicated that it was a very good product.	yes
实际收到产品的时候让我目瞪口呆，商品表面大面积磨损，多处其他地方都有磨损，不是次品就是旧品，稍后上图。	When I actually received the product, I was stunned. The surface of the product was worn in a large area, and there was wear in many other places. It was either a defective product or an old product. Later, the picture above showed that it was old.	yes
我申请退货，厂家的人看到图片后说是运输导致，这不是瞎说吗？	I requested a return, and the manufacturer's representative said it was due to transportation after seeing the picture. Isn't that a baseless claim?	yes
商品内部怎么可能磨损？	How does anything get worn down inside?	yes
只有两种可能，要么次品旧品，要么就是我故意损坏商品，然后拿去退货。	There are only two possibilities, either it's a substandard or used product, or I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.	yes
客观来讲，我没有证据证明我没有损坏商品，但是以我在亚马逊购物的信用记录来讲，我认为这样的商品不应该出现在亚马逊自营商品中，客户选择亚马逊自营就是信任，customer win，we win，客户的胜利就是厂商的胜利，希望大家一起努力改进，谢谢。	Objectively speaking, I have no proof that I did not damage the item, but considering my track record of Amazon purchases, I believe that such items shouldn't be included in Amazon's self-operated products, Customers choose to trust Amazon's self-operated products, customer win, we win, I hope everyone will work hard to improve, thank you.	yes
我使用该产品不到一年，就出现两个E2，我不知道如何处理?	I have been using this product for less than a year, and two E2s have appeared, I don't know how to deal with it?	yes
我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?	I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two groups on the right side of the receiver often showed red E2, which should be a problem with the transmitter module, right? This doesn't quite match what the Amazon website says about the transmitter module being able to work continuously for 7 years, right? I can't find after-sales service on the Amazon website, and now I don't know what to do?	yes
还行吧	Okay	yes
第一次购买是坏的。	The first purchase was faulty.	yes
感觉不像新的。	It doesn't seem brand-new.	yes

而且老是白屏。	And the screen is always white.	yes
换了以后好了。	It got better after changing it.	yes
换货挺迅速，晚上有点模糊，视角不是很广，但是普通家用够了。	Although the viewing angle is not very wide, the replacement is extremely quick, and it is a little hazy at night; it is sufficient for everyday home use.	yes
不足就是没有卡，自己买的，还有就是以前在亚马逊买过手机。	The disadvantage is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I bought a mobile phone from Amazon before.	yes
包装上会有贴纸，防止包装被打开，这次没有，买手机时候还有个贴纸一样的章，可以贴在保修卡上，这次没有。	There would usually be a sticker on the packaging to prevent it from being opened, but this time there wasn't. When buying a phone, there would also be a sticker-like seal that could be attached to the warranty card, but this time there wasn't.	yes
不知道是不是东西便宜了就没有，很困惑。	I don't know if it's because things are cheap, so I'm confused.	yes
等待供货商回复	Awaiting response from the supplier	yes
包装没有任何标识，直接给供货商致电说，回答没标识是正品，如怀疑可用边角料邮寄到强生公司验货，还留下车牌号以及电话号码，承诺会发短信通知把我的信息输入强生官网保修卡，到现在也没收到短信啊？	The packaging had no markings, so I called the supplier directly. They said that the lack of markings indicated that it was genuine, and if I had doubts, I could send a sample to Johnson & Johnson for verification.

日本亚马逊因为客服问题导致买家的利益严重受损（8c的毛毛虫发货为8cm的毛毛虫）（8c=14cm，8cm=2c）	Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service issues (delivering an 8cm caterpillar instead of an 8c caterpillar) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c).	yes
承认错误，但是一直在推诿，始终强调货物为第三方，不能约束第三方。	Admitting the mistake, but always refuting, always emphasizing that the goods are third parties and cannot bind the third party.	yes
订单编号：503-4265464-1830254。	Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.	yes
我当初购买的页面尺码选项为7c，8，9c，当时觉得这就是个陷阱，打电话给日亚中文客服，明确告知8就是8c，但是等商品回到中国才发现，只有8cm，我觉得这完全是故意设下的陷阱来坑中国人（按照亚马逊的售后），现在查看页面已没有这个选项。	When I originally purchased, the size options on the page were 7c, 8, 9c. I thought this was a trap, so I called Amazon's Chinese customer service and was clearly told that 8 meant 8c. However, when the product arrived back in China, I found out it was only 8cm. I believe this was a trap deliberately set to scam Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service). Now, this option is no longer available on the page.	yes
中方客服：很抱歉，给你带来损失了，我们给你两条路走：	Chinese customer service: We are very sorry for your loss. We give you two options:	yes
1，你退货，买家承担所有运费。	1. You return the goods, and the buyer bears all shipping costs.	yes
2，你不退货，我们补偿你1000日元。	2. If you do not return the product, we will compensate you 1,000 yen.	yes
（我算一下账，鞋子4000多日元，算作200rmb，选择1，我没有鞋子，损失在200元。	(Let me do the math, the shoes cost more than 4,000 yen, which counts as 200rmb, choose 1, I don’t have shoes, and the loss is 200 yuan.	yes
选择2，我有鞋子，最后补偿了我2000日元，最后损失在150rmb 客服：我们已记录下来，我们会认真处理，次日回了封邮件，说我不接受中方客服调解，就这么完了。	Choice 2, I have shoes, and finally compensated me 2,000 yen, and the final loss was 150rmb. Customer service: We have recorded it, and we will deal with it seriously. The next day, I replied an email, saying that I would not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service. It is over.	yes
我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	I said, the purchase page is about confusing options like 7c, 8, and 9c, and the Chinese customer service assistant said the Japanese code would not have a c like that, like 140, but have you seen other caterpillar pages?	yes
都有美码，日码混标的情况出现。	Both have a mixed label scenario with American and Japanese codes.	no
再说，你8cm为什么放在7c和9c中间，明明最小的尺码，你放那里算什么意思。	In addition, why do you place 8 cm between 7 cm and 9 cm when it is definitely the smallest size.	no
中方客服：我们提供中文服务，但是不知道你要运回国，所以你的运费我们是不予理赔的。	Chinese customer service: We offer Chinese service, but since we are unsure whether you'll be sending it back to your own nation, we are unable to cover your shipping expenses.	no
这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	This reasoning baffles me once more, I need Chinese customer service despite being Japanese, Customer service from Chinese speakers in Japan is unnecessary, the ability to place international long-distance calls is not a talent that visitors to Japan possess, who needs to call, This then becomes a question, nothing more than regular purchasing for me, Amazon is buying Chinese phones from other countries.	no
亚马逊中文客服不就是方便了我们海淘的这些人吗？	Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service simply more practical for those of us who shop from abroad?	no
这次购买不是很满意	This purchase is not very satisfactory	yes
这是第二次从亚马逊上购买帮宝适尿布，曾经在宝宝2个月的时候买过一箱，选择了欧洲进口纸张的尿布，第一次购买经历还是比较满意的，宝宝整夜就用一张尿布，的确可以满足12个小时不换尿布。	This is the second time I bought Pampers diapers from Amazon. I bought a box of diapers when my baby was 2 months old. I chose diapers made of paper imported from Europe. I was quite satisfied with the first purchase experience. The baby used them all night One diaper can indeed satisfy 12 hours without changing diapers.	yes
但是这次购买L号的尿布，一箱里面有2包分开包装，打开后就觉得纸张比较松，跟进口帮宝适有明显区别，给宝宝用了之后，还算可以，没有漏尿也没有红疹等迹象。	But this time I bought L-size diapers, and there are 2 packs in a box packed separately. After opening it, I feel that the paper is relatively loose, which is obviously different from imported Pampers. After using it for my baby, it is OK. There is no leakage of urine and there is no sign of rash.	yes
但是到了第二包尿布，开始使用后宝宝的大腿内侧立马就出现了红疹，至今还没有褪去。	However, after starting the second pack of diapers, a rash immediately appeared on the inside of the baby's thighs and has not yet faded.	yes
怀疑1箱里面的2包，质量还不一样啊。	The 2 products in 1 box might not be of the same quality, in my opinion.	yes
以后应该不会继续购买了！	I probably won't continue to buy in the future!	yes
希望重视包裹的运输保护	Hope to pay attention to the transportation protection of the package	yes
这是我网购这么久以来，看到最差的一次包装运输，完全没有什么保护措施，缓冲泡沫，包裹缓冲层材料等，什么都没有。	This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen since I have been shopping online for a long time. There are no protective measures at all, such as cushioning foam, wrapping cushioning layer materials, etc., nothing.	yes
就一个压变形的箱子。	Just a deformed box.	yes
而且里面的软胶盒包装的，卡盒都压开了压到变形了。	Moreover, the soft rubber boxes inside were packaged in such a way that the card boxes were squashed and deformed.	yes
希望是正品 质量有保证，以后是不怎么敢亚马孙买东西的了。	I hope it is genuine and the quality is guaranteed. I will not dare to buy things from Amazon in the future.	yes

说明亚马逊根本就不重视服务反馈这一块，和国内的京东、天猫等差太远了。	It shows that Amazon does not pay attention to service feedback at all, and it is far behind domestic JD.com and Tmall.	yes
好看，但有点点小遗憾	Good-looking, but a little bit of a pity	yes
整个杯子的颜色是我狠喜欢的，橘红色，虽然我家是男宝，但是还是觉得橘红配黄色很亮眼。	I really like the color of the whole cup. It's orange red. Even though I have a baby boy, I still think the orange red with yellow is very bright.	yes
比我想象的小一些，不过本来就是拿来带出门用的，所以还可以接受。	It was smaller than I thought, but it was supposed to be brought out, so it was acceptable.	yes
昨晚拿回家试了一下，瓶盖推开之后，吸管和盖子之间的距离太近了，因为吸管的位置是正向垂直的，所以儿子总是要把盖子上面的凸起含住喝水，觉得这个地方是否可以改进一下。	I brought it home to try last night, and after opening the bottle cap, I found that the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the position of the straw is vertically straight, my son always has to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water. I wonder if this could be improved.	yes
看来其他牌子的吸管杯把吸管做的倾斜还是有道理的，小孩子的东西，真的就是在乎安全和舒适。	It seems that other brands of straw cups make the straw slanted for a reason, children's things, really care about safety and comfort.	yes
轻便大容量	Lightweight, large capacity	yes
喜欢它轻便，开口大，就是两个独立的分隔袋对我来说有点多余，感觉不知道装什么好。	I like its lightness and large opening, but the two separate compartments seem a bit redundant to me, as I'm not sure what to put in them.	yes
买完发现海外购美亚上还有一只另一个牌子很类似的，才不到两百块。	After purchasing, I found another similar brand on the overseas shopping platform, Amazon, for less than two hundred yuan.	yes
假货，假的特别厉害	Fake goods, extremely fake.	yes
亚马逊卖假货，我也是服了。	I can't believe Amazon sells counterfeit goods.	yes
客服说因为用了所以不能退货，我没用怎么知道是假货。	The customer service said that because I used it, I couldn't return it. How would I know it was a fake if I didn't use it?	yes
因为信任，所以伤心，毕竟是抹脸的用品，真的去实体店买吧，认可贵一点。	Because of trust, there is sadness. After all, it's a facial product. It's better to buy it in a physical store, even if it's a bit more expensive.	yes
因为是秒杀，所以没有看评论，我已经提交国家工商总局的电商平台了，我们一起维权吧。	Because it was a flash sale, I didn't look at the reviews. I have already reported it to the National Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform. Let's protect our rights together.	yes
坏了？	Is it damaged?	yes
假货？	Counterfeit goods?	yes
总之悲剧。	Simply put, tragedy.	yes
用第二片的时候选的毛孔细致的，但是一打开就一股怪味，以为是正常的，因为没用过这款，然后往脸上贴的时候就整个受不了了，非常冲的味道，无法形容，熏到立马咳嗽了出来，眼睛也很痛，流眼泪，马上摘了去洗脸。	When I used the second piece, I chose the one for fine pores, but as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used this brand before. But when I put it on my face, I couldn't stand it at all. The smell was very strong, indescribable, and it made me cough immediately. My eyes were also very painful and teary, so I immediately took it off and washed my face.	yes
不信邪又开了一片同款的，没有那么重的味道了，现在正在敷。	I don't believe it but I opened another piece of the same type, it doesn't smell as bad and I'm putting it on now.	yes
回想起有点像发廊里劣质烫发水的味道。	It reminded me a bit of the smell of cheap perm solution in a hair salon.	yes
真无法想象，难倒亚马逊自营的护肤品从此也得避而远之了吗？	It's unimaginable. Is it really that Amazon's own skincare products will have to be avoided from now on?	yes
奸商啊	Profiteers	yes
当时购买的时候，活动页面上是说满99元赠送“三体全集”，收到货没有这个赠品，打客服电话说要给他们看当时活动的截图，问题是谁买东西还把网页截图保存啊，你们自己做过的活动，还需要顾客帮你们提供啊，各位买家下次要留个心眼，保存证据。	When I made the purchase, the promotion on the page said that a "Three-Body Trilogy" would be given for free with purchases over 99 yuan. However, I did not receive this gift when I received the goods. When I called customer service, they asked me to show them a screenshot of the promotion at the time. The problem is, who saves screenshots of web pages when they make purchases? You need customers to provide evidence for promotions you have run yourself. Buyers, be careful next time and keep evidence.	yes
用后感受	Feelings after use	yes
第一次在亚马逊买东西，分别感受有几点，先来说下用完商品的感受吧，第一确实是无痛，也没有刺激味道的东西，总体来说很不错的，静等8分钟左右一擦就掉了，只是会有少量的汗毛渣在上面，不细看是看不出来的，所以说总体是不错的，至于之后都就用一次还要继续观察，继续用才会知道。	This is my first time shopping on Amazon, and I have several impressions to share. Let's start with my feelings after using the product. Firstly, it is indeed painless and doesn't have any irritating smell. Overall, it's pretty good. After waiting for about 8 minutes, it can be wiped off easily, leaving only a small amount of hair residue on the surface, which is not noticeable unless you look closely. So overall, it's pretty good. As for the future, I need to continue observing and using it to know more.	yes
反正我觉得这个东西确实不错。	Anyway, I think this is really good.	yes
第二从27号下单，12号收到货，总共15天也就是半个月，亚马逊的送货员服务态度也很好。	Second, I placed an order on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th. A total of 15 days is half a month. Amazon's delivery staff has a good service attitude.	yes
第三，亚马逊的什么黑色星期五就不要相信了，星期五下单，等了2天就便宜了接近12块钱，也就是我买成170多（加上运费什么的），有一种搞活动就提价格的感觉样。	Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday. If you place an order on Friday and wait for 2 days, it's nearly 12 yuan cheaper, which means I bought it for more than 170 (plus shipping).	yes
客服说什么价格波动，我关注了10多天价格也就是这个样，波动也不大的。	I had been looking at the price for more than 10 days, and it's been like that, no big fluctuations.	yes
价格实惠，日原产，有中文标签，带颗粒，绝对回购！	Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese label, with granules, definitely repurchase!	yes
膏体里带颗粒的，清爽感恰到好处，用后牙齿爽滑，上比某二手东强太多啦，那里说是进口的东西，可好多东西没有中文标签，不知从哪里批发的。	There are granules in the paste, the refreshing feeling is just right, and the teeth are smooth after use. It is much better than a second-hand product. It says that it is imported, but many things do not have Chinese labels. I don't know where they are wholesaled from.	yes
以后只要亚马逊有的，绝不再去二手东。	From now on, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to second-hand Dong again.	yes
给个建议，亚马逊的app 上晒单怎么有时晒不了，希望能改进一些应用，会做的越来越好的！	Here's a suggestion, sometimes I can't post reviews on the Amazon app, I hope some improvements can be made to the application, it will get better and better!	yes
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	Over the years, Excellence has deteriorated to the point where there is no quality of service to speak of!	yes
垃圾卓越不顾及客户需求 下订单的时候特别配送时间19:00-22:00。	Garbage Excellence does not consider customer needs. When placing an order, the special delivery time is 19:00-22:00.	yes
因家里有术后卧床不方便的老人在，所以只有晚上可以方便收件。	Due to having an elderly person at home who is bedridden after surgery, it is only convenient to receive packages in the evening.	yes
结果竟然中午12点就直接上门送了，也不事先电话告知。	Surprisingly, they delivered it directly to the door at noon without giving any prior notice by phone.	yes
如果配送时间是你们快递员随心所欲的想几点就几点送，何必假惺惺弄个时间让客户选择？	If the delivery time is at the whim of your couriers, why bother pretending to let customers choose a time?	yes
如果自己的物流没办法保证服务的，那就干脆不要做电商了！	If your own logistics can't guarantee the service, then simply stop doing e-commerce!	yes
让一个身上3处伤口的老人下床开门收快递还要找零钱付费！	Making an elderly person with three wounds get out of bed to answer the door and pay for a delivery is outrageous!	yes
明明订单上有联系电话！	There is a telephone number on the order!	yes
从头到底也没有人来电话联系一下给个解释！	From the beginning to the end, no one called to give an explanation!	yes
卓越网所谓的投诉客服就是一帮子外地人在那里装样子，敷衍你的投诉然后给你一个所谓的答复。	The so-called customer service for complaints on the Excellence website is just a bunch of outsiders pretending, dealing with your complaints and then giving you a so-called reply.	yes
不会有任何改变或者补偿！	There will be no modification or payment!	no
之前也是遇到这样子了类似配送时间不对的问题也就忍了，但这次无法忍受，太过分了！	Similar issues have occurred before, and I was able to tolerate them, such as an incorrect delivery date, but this time it is too much for me to handle!	no
新书买的预售到货后竟然封面和封底是反的，这样子明显得质量问题就这样子闭眼把书发给顾客了？	You shipped the book to the client while still not paying attention to the fact that the back cover and front cover of the new book were sideways when it came after the pre-sale?	no
留言差评也不会有人来联系你。	No one will contact you if you leave a negative comment.	no
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	Over the years, Excellence has deteriorated to the point where there is no quality of service to speak of!	no
不会再在卓越上花一毛钱。	No more money will be spent on Excellence.	no
图片质量实在不能接受	The image quality is simply unacceptable.	yes
作为“古地图集”这样的标题，本书在图片的选择、排版、印刷上实在令人难以接受，有些图片甚至有马赛克，模糊到无法辨识。	For a book titled "Ancient Map Collection", the choice, layout, and printing of the images are simply unacceptable, with some images even pixelated to the point of being unrecognizable.	yes
即便本书不是专业的地图册，即便是小画幅插图，也应该对得起目录中祖先留下来的洋洋大观的中古文献资料！	Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small-format illustration, it should be worthy of the magnificent medieval documents left by the ancestors in the catalog!	yes
（况且很多图片是可以从相关行业资源中获取清晰的原始文件的），用这样的图片来拼凑图书与不使用图片有何差别？	(Besides, many pictures can be obtained from related industry resources with clear original documents). What is the difference between using such pictures to piece together books and not using pictures?	yes
！我为这样的治学精神感到遗憾。	I regret such an attitude towards scholarship.	yes
文字方面不予评价，方家各有分辨。	The text is not evaluated, and each party has its own way of distinguishing it.	yes
整体2星。	Overall 2 stars.	yes
高二的时候看的这本书当时只是抱着无聊看看玩的心态，感觉这样的书自己应该不会沉迷吧，毕竟起点的网文以往还是不太吸引我的。	When I read this book in my second year of high school, I was just reading it out of boredom. I didn't think I would get addicted to such a book, after all, web novels from Qidian have never been that appealing to me.	yes
然后...就掉坑里了。	Subsequently...it fell into the pit.	yes
按着这个剧情来说，整本书都是比较轻松愉快的，前部分叶修还在网游里的时候，即使是公会之间勾心斗角，也因为往往被叶神狗血，搞得一点也不沉重。	Following the plot, the whole book is quite relaxed and enjoyable. In the early part when Ye Xiu was still in the online game, even if there were intrigues between guilds, it was not heavy because it was often made light-hearted by Ye.	yes
至于到了比赛的部分，写出了时代的变迁新旧交替的一点点心酸之感（可能是我多愁善感）。	As for the competition part, it conveyed a bit of the bittersweet feeling of the changing times and the transition from old to new (perhaps I'm just sentimental).	yes
看整部书花了我高二许多学习时间，可是就是停不下来。	Reading the entire book took up a lot of my study time in my second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.	yes
全职对人物和感情线的描写让人十分惊艳，有的人物只是偶尔带过，也会给人留下很深的影响，像比较重点描写的角色叶修黄少天苏沐橙都有大量的粉丝，而不在写作中心的角色例如江波涛楚云秀等等也十分找人喜欢，在一个电竞的爽文中竟然让人找不到一个让人讨厌至极的人物，这是全职在人物描写上的成功。	The characters are often portrayed in a way that makes them feel like they are in the right place, and the characters are often portrayed in a way that makes them feel like they are in the right place at the right time, such as when they are in the right place at the right time, or when they are in the wrong place at the right time, such as when they are in the wrong place.	yes
而在感情线上，全职也没有一般网文所令人诟病的后宫佳丽三千万要么美女要么腐的毛病，全文所有人的感情，都有一个共同的地方就是他们喜欢着荣耀这个游戏，并且大都想要堂堂正正的胜利。	And in the relationship line, full-time also does not have the general net article is criticized by the harem beautiful thirty million either beautiful or corrupt fault, the full text of all the people's feelings, all have a common place is that they love the glory of the game, and most of them want to hallow the victory.	yes

全职的IP很大，也归功于此。	This is due in large part to full-time IPs.	yes
撇开网文这个文化现象不谈，全职不失为一本不错的书。	Full-time is still a terrific book even when the cultural phenomena of internet writing is disregarded.	no
多少他真的会给人提供一些热血，一点点感动。	He will essentially give a tiny touch and some hot blood.	no
今年4月份全职要动漫化。	In April of this year, animation will be full-time.	no
其实想要买齐这套书很久了，碍于永远钱包不够厚都没狠下心下手，然后想要买的时候就发现，tb上简直是假货猖獗，其实全职最近出了另一个版本，封面图吧我自己是蛮喜欢的，但还是打算先买老的版本，所以就在亚马逊上看了看，一次性买下来了一套。	In fact, I've wanted to acquire this collection of books for a while, but I've put it off since my wallet isn't thick enough, then, when I went to purchase it, I discovered that there were many fakes on tb, in truth, the cover image was just released in a different version by the full-time, I visited Amazon and ordered a set all at once because I personally really enjoy it but still intend to purchase the older version first.	no
接下来简单说一下货的情况。	Let's now briefly discuss the state of the products.	no
●第四本的塑封没有，但书是新的。	●The fourth book doesn't have a plastic cover, but it is brand-new.	no
●第十七本塑封是在但是被打开了，书的质感也很奇怪感觉没有其他的硬。	●The seventeenth book is still in its plastic packaging, but it has been opened, its texture is also quite odd, and it is not as hard as the others.	no
●第23本和第十七本情况一样，但是也比第十七本硬，但十分的旧。	●The 23rd book is identical to the 17th book, however, it is older and harsher than the 17th book.	no
●个别几本书的出版社不同好像第23和17就是同一个出版社，和其他的不同。	●Individual novels are published by various companies, in contrast to the others, it appears that the 23rd and 17th are published by the same company.	no
●整体来讲还算满意，24本很大一箱，很满足。	●Overall, I'm happy with the outcome, a sizable box contains 24 books, and I am pleased with my purchase.	no
落寞的小狮子	The Lonely Little Lion	yes
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Missing Piece" but it turned out that there are a lot of words!	yes
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	I read it three times before I finished reading this book for my kids. It's a little lion that can shoot, a little lion that loves fruit juice and gummies.	yes
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	When I saw the story of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urban people are a bit unreceptive to this arrangement of being eaten by animals.	yes
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	Seeing the end, this little lion who has succeeded in human society has lost himself. He is no longer a complete lion, nor is he a complete human being.	yes
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	In the end, there was only the back of the little lion, and I didn't know where he had gone.	yes
可能多年以后，这个小狮子的形象还留在长大了的小朋友的印象中，在某一天不经意的时候被想起，或许对她会有触动或是启发。	Maybe many years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the memory of the grown-up children, and if she is reminded of it inadvertently one day, it may touch or inspire her.	yes
性价比很高的作品集	Cost-effective collection of works	yes
1、以前还不知道TASCHEN，最近买了不少他们的书，原因就是太强悍，不论是选题还是制作本身。	I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but recently I've bought quite a few of their books because they are so impressive, both in terms of the topics they choose and the production itself.	yes
本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	There have been three versions of this work, the largest of which is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide, similar to the complete works of Michelangelo; the medium version is approximately 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and comes with a two-volume book box.	yes
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	It was also acceptable, as it was cheaper and more than 700 pages split into two, which could be easily read as a paperback edition; secondly, unlike the complete Michelangelo collection, which was dominated by paintings, the manuscript in black and white by Leonardo da Vinci was the majority, and the edition was the best value for money as an appreciation of the paintings and manuscripts for budget-constrained, non-art readers.	yes
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	The commentary on the painting section is excellent, with composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as The Last Supper), but due to either printing or book size issues, some shadow parts are too dark to see the details, which is a bit regrettable.	yes
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	In contrast to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer.	yes
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius, while the latter is so extensive and accomplished that it is not enough to describe as a genius.	yes
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	You will be rendered absolutely dumbfounded after reading the manuscripts if you could only comprehend half of Da Vinci from the artwork before.	yes
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Trash, who bought who regrets!	yes
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	I never give bad reviews, but this is genuinely rubbish. It's a waste of money. Give me a reason!	yes
1.走时不准，突然变成1月1号，时间归零了。	1. When the time is not right, it suddenly becomes 1 January, and the time goes to zero.	yes
2.劣质皮带，都不是硅胶的，带了手腕过敏起泡。	2. Inferior belts, none of which are silicone, bring wrist allergy blistering.	yes

4.续航只有五天。	The battery life is only five days.	yes

6.不防水。	6. It's not waterproof.	yes
7.其他。	7. Others.	yes
物流太慢	Logistics is too slow	yes
显示10月16号到，结果21号才收到，差评！	It was supposed to arrive on October 16th, but I only received it on the 21st. Bad review!	yes
快递太差，亚马逊上买东西本来就慢，没想到会这么慢！	The express delivery is too bad, and shopping on Amazon is already slow, but I didn't expect it to be so slow!	yes
总体满意	Overall satisfactory	yes
之前一开始还担心相机的包装，这次还好，里面有充气包，相机三码一致，也能在官网注册，快门次数0，其余的就只能等时间检验了 。	Initially, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was fine. There was an airbag inside, the camera's three codes matched, and it could be registered on the official website. The shutter count was zero, and the rest would have to be tested over time.	yes
发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	The delivery speed was quite fast, but I have to complain about the courier. He left the valuable item at the door and left quickly. I had no chance to open the box and check it in front of him, which left me speechless.	yes
商家发货前做到了为客户着想:)	The merchant has considered the customer's needs before shipping :)	yes
商家比较负责，专门打电话问所用相机的屏幕尺寸，确实替客户着想了。	The merchant was quite responsible, specifically calling to ask about the screen size of the camera used, truly considering the customer's needs.	yes
发货速度也快。	The delivery is also fast.	yes
金刚膜贴上去也挺合适和管用的。	The diamond film fits quite well and is effective.	yes
电池充不满	The battery cannot be fully charged.	yes
机器确实不错，想问下怎么第一次充电起就充不满啊，充电指示灯一直红色	The machine is indeed good, but I want to ask why it can't be fully charged the first time, the charging indicator light is always red.	yes
目前找不到亚马逊官方反馈渠道，所以只能在商品评价里反馈	Currently, I can't find an official feedback channel on Amazon, so I can only provide feedback in the product reviews.	yes
1. 在 3 月 29 号，通过预购途径使用 31 元购买了此书，显示 3 月 31 号会推送到设备上，此时亚马逊官网上还无法预览该书（因为还未发布）；	1. On March 29, I purchased the book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, and it shows that it will be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book cannot be previewed on Amazon's official website (because it has not yet been released);	yes
2. 3 月 31 号推送到设备上的书，内容是空白，只有敬请期待，而亚马逊上该书电子版降价到了 18 元；	2. The price of the book's electronic version on Amazon has been lowered to 18 yuan, and the content of the book that was pushed to the device on March 31 is blank;	yes
3. 这两天反复尝试将设备上的下载的空白的书进行删除，再次同步，都无法获取到包含实际内容的电子版《商业的本质》，但是看到亚马逊官网已经可以预览该书。	3. I have tried several times over the past two days to remove the downloaded blank book from the device and synchronize it again, but I am unable to download "The Essence of Business" in its entirety, however, I can see that the book can be previewed on Amazon's official website.	yes
目前我有几点感想	So, I have a few thoughts.	yes
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	The issue of price is not the most important, the key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books of actual content, rather than always downloading "coming soon".	yes
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	I probably won't buy pre-ordered books in the future, after all, if it gets postponed, downloading an empty book seems very complicated.	yes
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	3. I hope that Amazon will provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues. When there are doubts about the download or use of e-books, there will be a place to give feedback (work orders and online customer service are both acceptable, and you can refer to Microsoft’s official mall for how to do it. of)	yes
不是很推荐阅读	Not really recommended reading	yes
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it and write something about it from memory.	yes
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	This book is more of a collection of fragments about love in life than it is a compilation of short stories.	yes
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The tone of this book is extremely plain, like that of plain water, with the pursuit of simplicity in word choice and sentence construction taken to the extreme, and the plot is as quiet and plain as a street on a summer afternoon.	yes
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Each short story is a brief sketch of ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.	yes
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	Finally, they were collected together and titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."	yes
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I consider the title of this anthology of novels to be a type of performance art, the author aims to convey that love is more than only the emotions experienced on stage, the rocks and dry sea in urban tales, and the bond that binds you and I together, not only should the aforementioned not be seen as a representation of love, but also of a life that is dull day in and day out, as plain as water, with a loss of life, denial of reality, and uncertainty about the future.	yes
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	While you read this book, images of the quarreling couples around you, the uninteresting marriages of individuals you know, and the unsatisfying relationships can be running through your head.	yes
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	Since the writing and plot of this book are dull from an artistic standpoint, I do not advocate reading it, unless your life is difficult or sweet, like living in a candy castle, you will feel uncomfortable when you are forced to read it, not strange and dull.	yes
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	From a depth of thought perspective, the everyday plot does not dazzle or expand one's thinking and perspective (unlike Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief segments do not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?	yes
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	What led to the marriage of the main character's failure?	no
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	Because this book doesn't make much sense whether you read it or not, I do not suggest reading it.	no
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	This book's reading experience is generally subpar since the author's thoughts are conveyed more effectively through technique and genre than through a clear narrative.	no
适合粗读,不能细看。	It is appropriate for skimming, not for close reading.	yes
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	The logic of this book is good, but the content is not rich enough.	yes
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	It explains what and why many sales theories are, but it is weak in how to do it. It just points out the direction but does not give specific methods.	yes
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	Furthermore, the book feels like a patchwork.	yes
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	Examples include both domestic and foreign ones; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and unknown people.	yes
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	I don't know if it is a story compiled for the sake of example, but it will be more convincing if some cases experienced by the author are given.	yes
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	The terminology fluctuates between "customer" and "client".	yes
标题上还是顾客,正文中就变成客户了。	The title is "customer", but in the text it becomes "client".	yes
电子书中还出现了错别字、标点符号缺失、编号错误的问题。	There are also problems with typos, missing punctuation, and incorrect numbering in e-books.	yes
总之,这本书作为理论入门是个不错的选择,但对于已经从事销售工作想要提高销售水平的人就不太适用了。	Anyway, this book is a good introduction to the theory, but not very suitable for people already in sales work who are looking to improve their sales.	yes
快速了解互联网金融的导读书	A Quick Guide to Understanding Internet Finance	yes
这本书很浅，可以说只是一个入门课，可以帮助大家快速了解互联网金融的全貌，但要深入了解，还是要按图索骥，自己去深挖。	The book is shallow and can be said to be just an introductory course that can help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but if you want to know more about it, you have to find it and dig it yourself.	yes
且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	Moreover, the book was written quite early, and it does not mention the later subsidy wars between Alipay and WeChat to cultivate user habits. The current market share of third-party payments is probably much larger than what is mentioned in the book.	yes
现在好多人外出吃饭都是带个手机就好，商家也因为银行流水太高的原因，弃用银联了。	Nowadays, many people just bring their mobile phones when they go out to eat, and because of the high bank turnover, merchants have abandoned UnionPay.	yes
但还是非常感谢作者写出这本入门书，看得出作者起码有多年的金融观察经验，对国内外的金融发展史都十分熟悉，所以才能写成如此通俗易懂的内容。	Still, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It is clear that the author has many years of experience observing finance and is very familiar with the history of financial development both domestically and abroad, which is why he was able to write such accessible content.	yes
写高大空很容易，难的是写的通俗易懂。	It's easy to write high and mighty, but it's hard to write in a way that's easy to understand.	yes
欣赏你，更想让你知道！	I admire you, and I want you to know it!	yes
决定一个人工作满意度的第一要素不是薪水高低，而是在工作中是否得到了足够重视和赏识。	The primary factor determining a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they receive enough recognition and appreciation in their work.	yes
根据马斯洛需求层次理论，在人的基本生存需要得到满足后，最迫切的就是心理需要的满足——希望被理解、被肯定、被赏识。	According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, once a person's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.	yes
确实，对于国人来说，大部分是“爱你在心口难开”，即便是怀有爱、感激与赞赏也是默默放在心里不会说出来。	In fact, the majority of Chinese people are "I love you hard to express" people who will keep their feelings of adoration, thanks, and appreciation to themselves and refrain from expressing them out loud.	yes
作者在本书中阐述了五种赞赏的语言：肯定的言辞、精心时刻、服务的行为、称心的礼物、身体接触。	The author of this book explains the five languages of appreciation: physical touch, words of affirmation, acts of service, quality time, and desirable gifts.	yes
我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	I think what's important is not knowing what the five languages of appreciation are, but being able to genuinely use these five languages to appreciate and be grateful for the people around you, whether they are family, friends or colleagues.	yes
其实越是亲密的人越需要赞赏和感恩，这样我们的生活才会变得更加美好。	In fact, the closer we are, the more we need to appreciate and be grateful, so that our lives will become better.	yes
学会赞赏，企业也能在一定程度上挽留住人才，降低辞职率。	By learning to appreciate, companies can also retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.	yes
感谢译者给我们带来了精彩的国外的思想和世界。	Thanks to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and worlds.	yes
由于中西方文化背景等原因，语言之间或多或少会存在差异，如果有机会能看到作者原版相信会收获更多。	Due to reasons such as Chinese and Western cultural backgrounds, there are more or less differences between languages. If you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, I believe you will gain more.	yes
再次谢谢作者和译者以及编辑们的辛勤劳动！	Once more, I'd want to thank the authors, translators, and editors for their labor of love!	no
疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	Suspected shoddy goods, ask Amazon for strict scrutiny	yes
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, no weight, not even as good as street stall products, no weight, no barcode, and the ten-bag packaging is also loose, which is not a characteristic of qualified products at all; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, and I have applied for a return; It is completely a quality problem; it is recommended that merchants keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods; supplement: I bought a heart-to-heart, 23 yuan/10 rolls in the supermarket, and added a few comparison photos to further verify the fakeness of the product. Clearer references to avoid financial loss and further unhappiness!	yes
再度期望亚马逊能够一丝不苟，严把商品源头。	Once again, I hope that Amazon will be meticulous and strictly control the source of products.	yes
马马虎虎的产品，和期望有差距	The product is mediocre and does not meet expectations.	yes
优点：	Benefits:	yes
1. 大品牌，价格便宜。	1. Big brands and cheap prices.	yes
优点2：电机和刀片都是PANASONIC保证的，使用起来也还OK，但是和我期望有差距。	Advantage 2: Both the motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are okay to use, but there is a gap between the actual performance and my expectations.	yes
缺点：	Disadvantages:	yes
1. 充电没有指示灯，这个最基本你的电源指示都省下了，估计购买300元产品的客户，在松下PANASONIC的眼里，也是施舍，毫无尊重。	There is no charging indicator light, even the most basic power indicator is omitted. I guess for customers who buy a 300 yuan product, in the eyes of Panasonic, it is a handout, with no respect at all.	yes
2. 有强烈的异味 充电时候，哪怕仅仅充电10分钟，就可以闻到强烈的塑胶燃烧的那种味道。	There is a strong unpleasant smell when charging, even if it's only for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong scent of burning plastic.	yes
办公室试用了1天，搞的全屋子都是这种塑胶味道。	After a day of testing in the office, the whole room was filled with the smell of plastic.	yes
和我之前用过的同价位的飞利浦PHILIPS相比，虽然多了个刀头，但是松下这款产品，质量真是对不起消费者了。	Compared to the Philips product of the same price range that I used before, although this Panasonic product has an extra blade, the quality really lets consumers down.	yes
小包装	Little Package	yes
收到快递一看上面写着电商版就知道又掉坑里了，比超市买的小了好些，应该是M，跟商品介绍上面的图片包装不一样，所谓新版吧。	Upon receiving the package and seeing "e-commerce version" written on it, I knew I had fallen into a trap again. It was much smaller than what I bought from the supermarket, probably a size M. The packaging didn't match the product description and images, probably a so-called new version.	yes
三颗星是怪自己马虎没看清楚商品规格，你卖M码电商版我没意见，你货不对版是几个意思？	The three stars are because I was sloppy and didn't read the product specifications clearly. I have no problem with you selling the M-size e-commerce version. What does it mean that your product is not the right version?	yes
电商套路深，有时间还是去超市买了。	E-commerce routines are deep, so I still go to the supermarket to buy when I have time.	yes
就酱紫。	That's it.	yes
味道不喜欢	don't like the taste	yes
小孩很不喜欢牙膏的味道，每次都说辣，也许用别的词形容才更贴切，小孩的词库里暂时只有这个词。	The child doesn't like the taste of toothpaste very much, and always says it's spicy. Maybe it's more appropriate to use another word to describe it. For the time being, this word is the only word in the child's vocabulary.	yes
搞活动时候买的，很便宜，所以也不好意思给差评了，四星吧，不过不会再买了。	I bought it during a promotion, it was very cheap, so I feel bad giving a bad review. Four stars, but I won't buy it again.	yes
正品哟 包装好	Authentic product, well packaged.	yes
包装很完整，里面加了充气袋，没有网上评论的只有光秃秃一个产品的样子。	The packaging is very complete, with an air bag added inside, not just a bare product as some online reviews mentioned.	yes
瓶子外包装上还有一层塑料膜像图片上描述的一样，快递也很快，拍下第二天就来了。	The bottle's outer packaging also has a layer of plastic film as described in the picture, and the delivery was very fast, arriving the day after the order was placed.	yes
是正品，只是没货了，不知道什么时候再上架。	It's genuine, but it's out of stock, and I don't know when it will be available again.	yes
糟心的一次购物体验	A terrible shopping experience	yes
黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	I placed an order during Black Friday, but after waiting for a long time, I still didn't receive it. Upon inquiry, I found out that the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues around me and they all said they didn't sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said only the sender could initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. Finally, I found out that the package was mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of transfers, I finally retrieved the package. The outer packaging had been opened, but the product was still intact. I don't know if it has been used or not. Anyway, it was quite frustrating.	yes
错误的配图	Wrong photo	yes
我以为自己能够收到图1这样的耳机，没想到却收到了图2这样的耳机，图物不一致也就算了，耳机左右声音大小不一又是什么意思？	I thought I could receive a headset like Figure 1, but unexpectedly I received a headset like Figure 2. It's fine if the pictures are inconsistent, but what does it mean that the volume of the left and right earphones is different?	yes
虽然名称都是一样的，但还是希望大家能够小心注意，另外还请亚马逊负责人及时更换正确的配图，万分感谢。	Although the names are the same, I still hope that everyone can pay attention to it. In addition, I also ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct picture in time. Thank you very much.	yes
操作系统一般般	The operating system is mediocre.	yes
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	After using it for a while, overall the display is okay, I don't feel much difference, it's just that this system is frustrating to look at. The boot time is noticeably slow, and it's impossible to set it up well. The included software doesn't even need to be mentioned, and the response speed is even more average. Compared to my colleague's, it's not on the same level.	yes
看评论说很人性化的设计，我没有找到哪里人性化，遥控器这个常用的上下左右，返回键设计的位置实在是不敢恭维。	I read the reviews saying that the design is very user-friendly. I haven't found anything user-friendly. The position of the remote control, the commonly used up, down, left, left, and right, return button design is really unflattering.	yes
所以呢，就当个电视吧，再外加电视盒之类的用吧。	So, just treat it as a TV, and use it with additional things like a TV box.	yes
降价太厉害了	The price cut is too substantial	yes
降价太厉害了，一百多入现在99！	The price drop is too drastic, from over a hundred to now 99!	yes
在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	I have accumulated many unreviewed orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the review content for all of them.	yes
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I use this paragraph to evaluate, it means that this product is at least 85 points above.	yes
而比较差的产品，我绝对不会偷懒到复制粘贴评价，这样其他消费者在购买的时候会作为参考，而商家也会因此改进商品质量。	For poorer products, I will never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers will use them as a reference when buying, and the merchant will improve the quality of the product accordingly.	yes
低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	Low price, good cable, no fever, that's enough!	yes
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	It is such a cheap cable, but it should have reached the hdmi certification standard. Compared with the domestic Akihabara bullshit (the price is twice as expensive), the cable body is thick and soft, and the 7-meter transmission has no noise. Look for Baseus for the low price line in the future!	yes
东西还可以，但是亚马逊的售后服务真的比其他网站差太多了	Things are okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites	yes
下单后发现下错了，但是取消订单已经取消不了，网页联系在线客服一直显示错误链接，联系不上。	After placing the order, I realized I made a mistake, but I couldn't cancel the order. The link to contact customer service on the website kept showing an error, so I couldn't get in touch.	yes
到货后送货员给我打电话，我说我不要了，想取消订单的没取消成功，派送员就拿回去了，说先给我签收上，让我申请退货。	When the goods arrived, the delivery person called me. I said I didn't want it and wanted to cancel the order but couldn't. The delivery person took it back and said he would sign for me first and let me apply for a return.	yes
申请退货时才告知食品类一旦签收不能退货，没办法打电话给亚马逊客服，也是一样说法，签收不能退货。	When applying for a return, I was informed that food items cannot be returned once signed for. I had no choice but to call Amazon's customer service, and they said the same thing, that signed items cannot be returned.	yes
我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I have bought items that cannot be returned according to policy from JD.com and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc., and the customer service always allowed me to return them. Even when the diapers from JD.com had a strong smell after opening, the customer service still allowed me to return them. But with Amazon, it's not possible.	yes
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with them?	yes
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	They told me either I accept it myself, or let the delivery person buy it. The delivery person already has a hard job, why should I make him pay for something he didn't buy?	yes
行，我也不退了，我自己收下了，但是必须给你们的服务打1分	Okay, I accept it myself and will not want a refund, but I must give your service 1 point	yes
劝大家不要白花钱	Advise everyone not to waste money	yes
首先满怀期待购买，觉得都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧，收到了以后看包装觉得还可以，个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感，吃到嘴里完全没有味道，寡淡无味，咬开来果肉一圈是暗黄色就是坏了那种，好坏参着卖的，能吃的也就不到三分之一，劝大家不要买，也不便宜，质量太差了！	In the first place, if you look at the packaging, you can see that it is good, but there is a box that is basically soft and soft, and the appearance is not visible, you have to feel it, eat it in your mouth completely without taste, you have no taste, you bite the pulp a circle is dark yellow or bad, it is good or bad, you can eat less than a third, you are advised not to buy it, it is not cheap, the quality is too bad!	yes
吃一堑长一智，以后再也不在电商买水果了！	I learned from my mistakes and will never buy fruit from an e-commerce company again!	yes
产品防伪标识在哪里	Where is the product's anti-counterfeit label?	yes
瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的，从外包装袋看，感觉蹂躏的程度让人揪心，毕竟是食物类的包装太简单了，而且还是属于国际购的，还有没看到什么明显的防伪标识标志，开瓶非常轻松，关键是盖内的一层蜂蜜直接从里面冒出来了，有开口几乎是没有什么粘连性，外国产品都是这样的吗？	The bottom corner of the bottle is severely dented, which should have been caused by a strong impact. Looking at the outer packaging bag, the degree of damage is distressing, especially since it's food packaging and it's too simple. Moreover, it's an international purchase, and I didn't see any obvious anti-counterfeit labels. Opening the bottle was very easy, and the key point is that a layer of honey directly came out from inside the cap. There was almost no stickiness when opened, is this how all foreign products are?	yes
生在中国的我有点不理解了。	As someone born in China, I'm a bit confused.	yes
应该是正品吧？	It should be genuine, right?	yes
还有拍下时提示二十几号到，这个是14号收到的，我第一次在这里海外购，只是把自己的疑惑写下来，或许这都是正常的？	Also, when I placed the order, it indicated that it would arrive around the 20th, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time shopping overseas here, I'm just writing down my doubts, maybe all of this is normal?	yes
提货服务有待改进	Improved pick-up service is required	yes
我一共买了5份提货券，在提取时，第一次预约提取3份，结果只寄过来2份，经过多方沟通才确认是漏发、答应后需补发；第二次预约，刚好赶上休息日，网站和微信均无提示需要在工作日预约，造成了不必要的恐慌，建议以后改善。	I bought a total of 5 pick-up vouchers. When I went to pick them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 for the first time, but only 2 were sent. After multiple communications, it was confirmed that one was missed and promised to be sent later. The second appointment happened to be on a rest day. Both the website and WeChat did not indicate that appointments need to be made on working days, causing unnecessary panic. I suggest improvements for the future.	yes
不错的购物	Good shopping	yes
东西好评！	Nice stuff!	yes
还是比较相信亚马逊自营的东西，现在海外购以后很方便，从国外买回来物流时间比国内也就多几天，不得不说亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的，比走转运要快很多，所以现在很多东西都在海外购上买。	I still believe in Amazon's self-operated products. Now it's very convenient to buy overseas, and the delivery time is only a few days longer than domestic ones. I have to say that Amazon's customs clearance capabilities for overseas purchases to China are still very strong, which is faster than transshipment. Much faster, so many things are now purchased overseas.	yes
希望国内商品的质量和价格能够更好一些，很多东西都是国内产的，但是出去转一圈买回来比在国内还便宜，希望改进。	I hope that the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, many things are domestically produced, but it is cheaper to go out and buy back than in China, and I hope to improve.	yes
垃圾	Garbage	yes
看到这样的包裹，试问大家:觉不觉得是路边的垃圾?	Seeing such a package, I ask everyone: Don't you think it's garbage on the side of the road?	yes
一个塑料易碎的包装，就用一个塑料袋从所谓的德国发过来，这样的包装是负责的吗?	A plastic fragile package is sent from the so-called Germany in a plastic bag. Is such a package responsible?	yes
我看这样的包装是装垃圾一样的，购买这个产品，包装及其简陋，没有任何防止破损的措施，就一个简单的塑料袋包装，到手后，包裹完全变形了，里面的物品也有破损。	I see this packaging as if it's for garbage. The product was purchased with extremely shoddy packaging, with no measures to prevent damage. It was simply wrapped in a plastic bag. Upon receipt, the package was completely deformed and the items inside were damaged.	yes
如果我只是碰到一个这样的，我认了，买了几个都是这样子，找亚马逊客服，客服就说可以退，但运费垫付，然后运费以礼品卡的形式返回给我。	If I just encountered one like this, I would accept it, but I bought several like this, contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I could return it, but I had to pay for the shipping, and then the shipping cost would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.	yes
我试问一下，我用现金支付运费，你们给我返礼品卡，这是要我自己买你们礼品卡就直说啊，还要自己把产品邮寄到德国仓库，这不是买个产品受罪啊!	I have a question, if I pay the shipping fee in cash, and you give me a gift card in return, are you asking me to buy your gift cards? And I have to send the product to the warehouse in Germany myself, isn't this making purchasing a product a hassle!	yes
而我一直跟客服说，出现这样的问题是谁的责任，客服却半句不说是他们的责任，连半句责任都不敢担当，这样的售后服务还有什么保障呢? 一句话:认栽!但我估计我这个评价，亚马逊都不会给公布的机会，直接回删除!	I kept asking the customer service who was responsible for this issue, but they didn't admit it was their fault, not even a word of responsibility. What kind of guarantee does such after-sales service provide? In one word: admit defeat! But I guess Amazon won't even give me the chance to publish this review, they'll just delete it!	yes
质量很好5星，物流很差	Good quality, 5 stars, poor logistics	yes
1，质量很好，秒杀的，价格适中，物超所值。	1. The quality is very good, it is a flash sale, the price is moderate, and it is worth the money.	yes
2，结实、用料足、焊点牢固、表面处理得当、颜色很好。	2. Strong, sufficient materials, firm solder joints, proper surface treatment, and good color.	yes
3，物流是硬伤，3号下的单，11号到的。	3. The logistics is flawed. The order was placed on the 3rd and arrived on the 11th.	yes
4，如果亚马逊没有标注预计到货时间是2月7号，我或许会很满意。	4. If Amazon didn't mark the expected delivery date as February 7th, I might be very satisfied.	yes
5，但标注了预期到货时间，就相当于给用户一个承诺，当承诺无法兑现的时候，用户很难受。	5. However, marking the expected delivery time is equivalent to giving the user a promise. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user feels very bad.	yes
6，如果你没有给予承诺的把握，请不要做出承诺。	6. If you are not sure of making a promise, don't make a promise.	yes
7，实际上，我非常在意商家做出的承诺。	7. In fact, I am very concerned about the promises made by merchants.	yes
8，所以，我打了低分。	8. So, I gave a low score.	yes
金线会掉色	The gold thread will fade in color.	yes
效果还是有的，但感觉是否明显，就看个人咯，或是心理作用。	The effect is there, but whether it is felt is a matter of personal preference, or psychological effect.	yes
有一点不太好的，就是金色的线，本来设计出来是觉得好看，但实际上，这个金线会掉色，往车上一放，如果拿动几次，手上，和车上，会有一些金粉。	One downside is the golden thread, which was originally designed for aesthetics, but in reality, this gold thread fades. If it is placed in the car and moved a few times, there will be some gold dust on the hands and in the car.	yes
希望产品可以改进。	I wish the product could be enhanced.	yes
这种方形的，也没啥装饰效果，就不要搞金线上去，掉下来在车上弄脏车还麻烦。	This kind of square shape has no decorative effect, so don't put gold wires on it, it will be troublesome if it falls off and stains the car.	yes
东西完好，速度可以，分2个包裹还不同包装	The items are intact, the speed is acceptable, and they are divided into two packages with different packaging.	yes
8天的速度蛮快的，但就是2件分了2个包裹，包装还不一样，明显一个防震太多了，厚纸板贴着，封了层塑料，外包装也方便拆，一个就国内的快递盒似的，放了几个缓冲气囊就算事了，感觉有点敷衍。	The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but the two items were split into two packages, and the packaging was not the same. One was obviously over-protected, with thick cardboard attached and a layer of plastic sealed, and the outer packaging was also easy to unpack. The other one was like a domestic express box, with a few air cushions considered done, which felt a bit perfunctory.	yes
雅兰床垫真心不错	The Yalan mattress is really nice	yes
34CM的床垫不是一般的厚，不要床直接睡床垫都可以了。	The 34CM mattress is unusually thick, you can sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.	yes

并不是自营商品，亚马逊无耻了	It's not a self-operated product; Amazon is shameless	yes
页面明确标注自营，实际上由供应商配送，售后由供应商负责，出问题自行联系供货商。	The page clearly indicates that it is self-operated, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier, the after-sales service is the responsibility of the supplier, and if there are any problems, you need to contact the supplier directly.	yes
想取消订单，对不起，订单信息已传递给供应商，不能取消；想退换货，在亚马逊成功申请了退换货，对不起，没有人理你，需要自行联系供货商退货。	If you want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has already been passed to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; if you want to return or exchange goods, even if you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon, sorry, no one will pay attention to you, you need to contact the supplier for returns yourself.	yes
这尼玛哪门子自营商品。	What the hell kind of self-operated merchandise is this?	yes
商品不是亚马逊配送，售后亚马逊不承担，客服竟然说“我帮你联系供应商”，还声称就是自营，太无耻了，赤裸裸的不要脸，赤裸裸的对消费者进行欺诈！	The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not take responsibility for after-sales service. The customer service even said "I will help you contact the supplier," and claimed that it is self-operated. This is too shameless, blatantly faceless, and blatantly defrauding consumers!	yes
郁闷的体验	A depressing experience	yes
之前在别家网购的滤芯，过滤效果不错，28天结束之后再用多一两天也一样没有水垢。	The filter cartridge I previously bought online from another store had a good filtering effect, and even after 28 days, there was no scale even if it was used for an extra day or two.	yes
由于一直以来在亚马逊购置的东西品质都可以，这次就想着在这边买，第一次在亚马逊买滤芯，感觉不太好，不但早早就开始有水垢，而且滤芯一直用到第28天，都会有悬浮的小黑碳粉，真不知道是继续用下去，还是直接扔了好，非常郁闷~	Since the quality of the items I've always bought from Amazon has been good, I thought I'd buy from here this time. This is my first time buying a filter cartridge on Amazon, and the experience is not very good. Not only did scale start to appear early, but there was also floating small black carbon powder in the filter cartridge all the way to the 28th day. I really don't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. Very frustrating~	yes
没有想象的那么好	It's not as good as it looks.	yes
和我以往用过的插线板比较，外部做工一般，内部如何未拆开看，但愿如店家所描述，从使用方便性上看，每一独立单位是否通电缺少显示	Compared with the power strips I've used before, the external workmanship is average, I haven't opened it to see the inside, but I hope it's as the shopkeeper described. From the perspective of ease of use, whether each independent unit is powered lacks display.	yes
包装破损了，等时间来检验产品的质量。	While waiting for the right moment to assess the product's quality, the box is damaged.	yes
外包装破损较严重，里面的包装盒似乎是新的，但是说明书好像不是新的，九月才装修，囤货中，希望到时候不会是坏的，请亚马逊解释一下为什么好几个顾客提到包装破损，你们却能安然处之，谢谢！	The outer packaging is severely damaged, the inner box seems to be new, but the instruction manual doesn't seem to be new. I just renovated in September and am stocking up, I hope it won't be broken by then. Amazon, please explain why several customers mentioned damaged packaging, yet you seem to be okay with it. Thank you!	yes
总体不错，有点小问题	Overall good, a little problem	yes
第一次购买滤水壶，看了几篇评价文章，感觉LAICA的性价比高些就选择了这个，收到货按说明书装好了滤芯，试用了一下，感觉总体不错，但是在倒水的时候好像原水会从壶嘴的地方与处理后的水混合（原水仓密封不太严）。	This was my first time buying a water filter jug. After reading several reviews, I felt that LAICA offered better value for money, so I chose this one. After receiving the product and installing the filter according to the instructions, I found it generally satisfactory. However, it seems that the unfiltered water might mix with the filtered water when pouring, as the seal on the raw water compartment doesn't seem very tight.	yes
用的时候一定要等所有水过滤完再倒出！	When you use it, you must wait for all the water to be filtered before pouring it out!	yes
图片不完整	The image is incomplete.	yes
图片没有拍出侧面的细节，侧面的细节跟主体的风格并不一致，有很大差别，这是其一；这个珠子是泰国产的，没有标明产地，这是其二；没有标明质地，这是其三；我在英国买的时候，分明每项各有盒子，这里只有一个简简单单的塑料袋，而且珠子上面没有任何的产品标志，我哪里判断得出是真是假。	The picture does not show the details of the side. The details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body. There is a big difference. This is one. This bead is made in Thailand, and there is no indication of the place of origin. This is the second. There is no indication of the texture. This is the third. When I bought it in the UK, it was clear that each item had its own box. There was only a simple plastic bag here, and there was no product logo on the beads. How could I judge whether it was true or not.	yes
购买要慎重哦，尤其是买香港出来的东西。	It is important to be careful about what you buy, especially if it comes from Hong Kong.	yes
亚马逊客服真烂	Customer support on Amazon is atrocious	yes
两天前下的订单，今天收到就发现降了40块钱，花了好多时间找到客服，客服说没法补差价，可以重买并退货。	The order placed two days ago, received it today and found that it was reduced by 40 yuan, and it took a lot of time to find customer service, and the customer service said that there was no way to make up the difference, and it could be repurchased and returned.	yes
这种客户体验和服务比某宝某东真是差一万倍。	This customer experience and service is 10,000 times worse than some of the other deals.	yes
还行，作为新手来说，值得入手	Okay, for a beginner, it's worth purchasing	yes
品相过得去，和极品金刚没得比，之前看过商场那个价格，少说都好几百，我是第一次玩金刚，还行。	The quality is decent, not comparable to the best King Kong. I have seen the price in the mall before, at least several hundred. This is my first time playing King Kong, and it’s okay.	yes
东西不错	It's a good thing.	yes
东西着实不错，送女友的，只是中午我不在加拿快递的时候有些不愉快，物流公司直接放邮件寄存宝里并且没发取件的验证短信给我，害我跑了两趟。	The product is really good, a gift for my girlfriend, but I had some unpleasant experience with the delivery at noon when I was not in Canada. The logistics company directly put it in the mail storage box and did not send me a verification message for pick-up, causing me to make two trips.	yes
不过宝贝确实不错。	But the item is indeed good.	yes
值得购买	Worth purchasing	yes

我等了2个小时也没有等来那个专员的电话，期间我主动联系了亚马逊客服，并邮件发送了客服让她给我回电话。	I waited for two hours for the commissioner to call, and during this time, I called Amazon customer service and emailed the customer service to call me back.	yes

6对我来说我只能继续等待...	For me, I can only continue to wait.	yes
底不平	The bottom is not flat	yes
因为看点评里说的都很好，所有对这款锅很有期待，拿到手的时候也很喜欢，很轻巧，但开锅的时候就发现问题了，锅底不是平的，中间突起来，周边凹下去，油都跑到周边了，特意买来的开锅大肥肉炸出好多油都没法覆盖中央区域，糊了，开锅都开不了，这样的构造估计没法正常煮菜。	Because the reviews were all very good, I had high expectations for this pot. I was very pleased when I received it because it was lightweight. However, I encountered a problem when I started to use it. The bottom of the pot is not flat, it bulges in the middle and dips around the edges, causing all the oil to run to the sides. The large piece of fatty meat I specifically bought to season the pot produced a lot of oil, but it couldn't cover the central area and got burnt. I couldn't even season the pot properly, and I doubt I can cook normally with this design.	yes
不知道是否我运气不好，刚好拿到个底子不平的锅，幸亏亚马逊提供一个月的退货服务，果断退了。	I don't know if I was unlucky and just happened to get a pan with an uneven bottom, but fortunately Amazon offers a one month return, so I decisively returned it.	yes

顶盖的弧度和控制面板的弧度居然不一致，拼合之后出现了一个最高2mm左右的高差。	The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel are not consistent, after piecing together there is a height difference of up to 2mm or so.	yes
虽然看起来是一个很小的缝隙。	Although it looks like a small gap.	yes
但是可以说是把整个设计感都摧毁了。	But it arguably destroys the whole sense of design.	yes
有点心疼那个产品设计师。	I feel a bit sorry for that product designer.	yes
看来美的的产品经理还没有能力去打造这样的水准的产品。	It appears that the product managers at Midea are still unable to produce goods of this caliber.	no
（对于售后小姐的回馈当然不能要求太高，但当我听到售后说道这款产品所有的个体都是这样的，不是只有我买的这件有问题时，她的不以为然和如实重负的情绪让我明白对美的也不能要求太高） 2019-7-7水泵故障出水量少，已经第二次维修，第一次维修后两周又坏了。	(Of course, I can't expect too much from the after-sales representative, but when I heard her say that not just the product I purchased has issues, but all individuals who use it do as well, I realized that you can't expect too much from Midea), The water pump stopped working on July 7, 2019, and there was little water output, following the second repair, which was made two weeks following the first, it broke once more.	no

亚马逊说周年活动320大优惠，后来发现大家249,289,299都有，瞬间有种被欺骗感，但是去超市对比了一下依然比同价位各种杂牌划算多了，今后外出可随车携带。	Amazon said there was a big discount of 320 for the anniversary event, but later found out that everyone had 249, 289, 299, and instantly felt deceived. However, after comparing with the supermarket, it's still much more cost-effective than various off-brands at the same price, and it can be carried with the car when going out in the future.	yes

太小，没伞套，材质一般。	Too small, no umbrella cover, average material.	yes
根本不是大号！	It's not a large size at all!	yes
第二把Totes，1.这把没有伞套 2.伞柄材质一般 3.明明写Large,实际上就是一人用的便捷雨伞,两个人用估计够呛。	The second Totes, 1. This one has no umbrella cover 2. The material of the umbrella handle is average. 3. It is clearly written as Large, but it is actually a convenient umbrella for one person. It is probably not enough for two people.	yes

感觉不太好	I'm not feeling too good about this.	yes
首先是箱子并不怎么结实，用加按一下就变形了，其次是背面设计的平放时防止箱面的ABS刮花并起不了作用，再次是箱子里面就是一块布包着、拉杆的地方凸显出来..等等，各种不满意，最后拉链有点不顺畅。	Firstly, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms with a little pressure, secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS surface of the box from getting scratched when laid flat, thirdly, inside the box is just a piece of cloth with the handle area protruding.. and so on, various dissatisfactions.

优点：这款双肩包比较精致，看起来耐用。	Advantage: This backpack is quite delicate and appears to be durable.	yes
缺点：卡片上的二维码扫不到（搞什么鬼），15.6寸的笔记本放不下（再长一点点行不行），这款双肩包拉链可以锁起来，却不为买家准备一把锁，不可谓服务至上。	Disadvantages: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook cannot fit (it could be a little longer), the zipper of this backpack can be locked, but there is no lock for the customer, and it cannot be described as service-oriented.	yes

一直在用925-25,非常棒，刚收到925-85，笔的质量没的说，样式也非常漂亮，之所以给四星是因为笔有点重，不适合快速写字，笔帽调节铅芯长度处有点晃动，个人意见：925-25要比85更顺手。	I've been using the 925-25, which is great. I just received the 925-85, the quality of the pen is unquestionable and the style is very beautiful.

开始我以为是那首歌音效的缘故没有多想，可后来听了半天我才发现这个问题很严重，不光偏音，低音效果也没我之前那个听起来好了，还有些许杂音，是只有我买的这个紫色的有这个现象吗？还是现在耳机制造工艺确实不行了呢?

现在多用开关电源，这个傻大的变压器估计得有4KG。	The majority of power supplies used today are switching power supplies, and this ridiculously huge transformer weighs approximately 4KG.	no

首先说一句刚买了几天就发现降价了，差评，本还算不错，性价比高，cpu和显卡足够应付主流网游和相当一部分大型单机了，散热非常好，但屏幕有点漏光(ips屏的通病)，音响质量不太好，硬盘不好(建议自己花点钱加个固态)，昨天拿去售后检测了一下硬件，没有任何问题，自带的win8.1不太好用，建议升级成10，卖家发货很快，各项询问回答的也很快，收到电脑第二天发票就到了，不错，可惜什么赠品都没有。	First of all, I found out that the price dropped just a few days after I bought it, which is disappointing. The product itself is quite good, with high cost performance. The CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable part of large single-player games. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen has a bit of light leakage (a common problem with IPS screens). The sound quality is not very good, and the hard drive is not good (I suggest you spend some money to add a solid state drive). Yesterday I took it to the after-sales service for a hardware check, and there were no problems. The pre-installed Win8.1 is not very user-friendly, I suggest upgrading to 10. The seller shipped quickly and answered all inquiries quickly. The invoice arrived the day after I received the computer, which is good, but it's a pity that there were no gifts.	yes
(顺便提一句买键盘贴膜一定不要去某宝一家叫E酷数码中心的店买，发货慢质量差，产品有问题不退不换，老板还满嘴脏话，特别曝光一下)	(By the way, when buying keyboard film, definitely do not go to a Taobao store called E Cool Digital Center. The delivery is slow, the quality is poor, and they do not accept returns or exchanges for faulty products. The owner also uses foul language. Just a special mention.)	yes
东西很好，平台官僚依旧	The product is very good, but the platform bureaucracy remains.	yes
硬盘质量非常好，性价比绝对高，比香港买还便宜，不急着用和可以忍受物流的话绝对推荐购买。	Hard drives are of very good quality and cost effective, cheaper than those purchased in Hong Kong, and are highly recommended if they are not in a hurry and can tolerate logistics.	yes
但不得不说的是亚马逊平台之官僚依旧，与几年前我发誓绝对不用的时候没有改进，你永远查不到实际物流状况，信息永远是几个星期以后送到，永远不能投诉，就是这么官僚！	However, I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform remains the same as when I swore never to use it a few years ago. You can never check the actual logistics status, the information is always that it will be delivered a few weeks later, you can never complain, it's just so bureaucratic!	yes
货收到几天了，物流信息还是10几天后你将会收到货！	The goods have been received for a few days, but the logistics information still says you will receive the goods in about ten days!	yes
物流不省心	Logistics is a headache.	yes
送来成这个样子，不仅包装压扁，电器包装也是开的，也不知道有没有调包。	It arrived in this condition, not only was the packaging crushed, the appliance packaging was also open, I don't even know if anything was switched.	yes
FYI	FYI	yes
还没有试用，一贯信赖飞利浦，希望电池寿命比其它牌子要长一些。	I haven't used it yet, but I always trust Philips, so I'm hoping the battery life is longer than that of other brands.	yes
上网查了，可能是进水的通病，而且没有保修。	I looked it up online, it might be a common problem with water ingress, and there's no warranty.	yes
郁闷！	Depressed!	yes
现在裹上保鲜膜继续用，不知能用多久？	Now that it's wrapped in cling film and continues to be used, I wonder how long it can last?	yes
买到别人拆开过的	Bought something that has been opened by others.	yes
三百多的机器要一百多的税确实比较高，看现在再六百多心里平衡多了。	A machine with a price of more than 300 yuan and a tax of more than 100 yuan is indeed relatively high. I see that now there is more balance in the mind with a price of more than 600 yuan.	yes
收到的时候封口胶条状态看着就很不对，像是拆开过，赶紧先拍了照，果然一撕就开了，打开后里面的纸板还有损坏，担心是别人退的，还没到纪念日就赶紧先给老公试试了，结果机器一点电都没有，还好刀头里面没有胡渣，要不大老远的咋退啊！	When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape looked very wrong, as if it had been opened. I quickly took a picture, and sure enough, it opened as soon as I tore it. After opening it, the cardboard inside was also damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I hurriedly let my husband try it before the anniversary. As a result, the machine had no power at all, luckily there was no stubble inside the blade, otherwise how would I return it from so far away!	yes
好不好用或者短期会不会有什么问题还未知，如前面的评价，缺货时发出的东西确实不靠谱！	It is unknown whether it is easy to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term. As mentioned earlier, the things sent out when they are out of stock are really unreliable.	yes
体验感中偏上水平	Above average in terms of experience.	yes
差不多顶级电动了，有很多种洁牙模式，但是很少人会天天换不同模式刷吧。	It's almost top-of-the-line electric, with many different tooth cleaning modes, but few people would change modes every day.	yes
用了半年没有啥问题，每天刷，差不多1个多星期一冲。	I've been using it for half a year without any problems, brushing every day, and it needs to be charged about once a week.	yes
刷头配件在亚马逊买同样便宜。	On Amazon, brush head accessories are equally affordable.	yes
App有点难用，除了改一下颜色那些，其他貌似兼容的问题是海外版的原因？	The app is a bit difficult to use, apart from changing the colors and such, it seems that other compatibility issues are due to the overseas version?	yes
希望学学大法的。	I hope to learn Dafa.	yes

综上，非常成功的一次购买。	In conclusion, this was a very successful purchase.	yes
有假货	There are counterfeits.	yes
上次买了两包，居然是两种不同的版本，本来包装上左下角的字是绿色的，结果有一包就不是，是白色的字，结果猫猫吃了就拉肚子了。	The last time I bought two packs, there were actually two different versions. Originally, the words on the lower left corner of the pack were green, but it turned out that one pack was not, and the words were white. As a result, the cat got diarrhea after eating it.	yes
是亚马逊的货源是假的，还是发货时被员工掉包，我确定不了。	I can't confirm whether the goods from Amazon are fake, or if they were switched by the staff during delivery.	yes
我会再买一次，如果还是假货，我就要找你们相关人士追责了。	I will buy it again, and if it is still fake, I will hold you accountable.	yes
是横杠的！	It's a horizontal bar!	yes
亚马逊图片上是斜杠的，结果给我发来是横杠的，这不是骗人吗?	The picture on Amazon shows a slash, but what they sent me is a horizontal bar, isn't this deceiving?	yes
效果还行	The effect is fine.	yes
猫猫喜欢吃，这是重点。	Cats love to eat, and that's the point.	yes
也确实有效果。	And it is effective.	yes
紧、窄，箍脚、磨脚背。	Tight, narrow, hoop feet, grind the instep.	yes
不推荐。	Not recommended.	yes
1.UN是clarks最舒服的系列，可惜这款太差了。	1. UN is the most comfortable series of Clarks, but it's a pity that this model is too bad.	yes
追加：今天对比了以前的UN系列鞋垫（鞋扔了垫留着用），材质比以前差了不少，弹性不如以前，透气也不如以前，就是假假的软。	Addendum: Today I compared the insoles of the previous UN series shoes (the shoes were thrown away but the insoles were kept for use), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it's just falsely soft.	yes
2.我的脚背不算高，硌的部位在脚背最高处向前3公分左右。	2. The instep of my instep is not too high, and the cruciate part is about 3 cm forward from the highest point of the instep.	yes
3.海外购买了三双clarks，只有一双合适。	3. Only one pair of the three pairs of Clarks I purchased abroad fits.	yes
吓得我把收藏夹里的其乐都删了。	I was so scared that I deleted all the Clarks from my favorites.	yes
回头试试rockport，不行只能去ecco实体店了。	I'll try Rockport next, if it doesn't work, I'll have to go to the ECCO physical store.	yes
以次充好，品控不好	The quality control is poor, substituting inferior for good.	yes
首先，值得肯定的是Prime海外购Ups很给力，31号下的单6号就收到了。	First of all, what is worth affirming is that Prime is very effective in buying Ups overseas. The order placed on the 31st was received on the 6th.	yes
鞋子颜色比图片好看很多，皮质感觉不错。	The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.	yes
鞋码稍大一点点，25脚长10.5宽拍的7.5W，上脚稍微有点宽松，不过平时就喜欢穿宽松一点，垫一双鞋垫刚好。	The shoe size is a little bigger, 25 feet long, 10.5 wide, and 7.5W. The upper foot is a little loose, but I usually like to wear looser shoes, and a pair of insoles are just right.	yes
其次，这个鞋子品控真的不敢恭维，一只鞋底胶有破损，另外一只鞋面有各种擦痕还有个针眼，鞋面与鞋底连接处胶条错位，明摆着的以次充好！	Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not flattering. The rubber on one sole is damaged, and the other upper has various scratches and a needle eye. The rubber strip at the connection between the upper and the sole is misplaced, which is obviously shoddy!	yes
有点后悔！	I sort of regret it!	yes
做活动280块买到的，这个价格买到亚瑟士相当划算，当然看评论还有更低的价格。	I bought it for 280 yuan during a promotion, which is quite a good deal for Asics. Of course, according to the reviews, there are even lower prices.	yes
现在说一下鞋子，优点：鞋子很轻，跑步挺舒服，也比较合脚，不会松松垮垮的。	Now let’s talk about the shoes. Advantages: The shoes are very light, comfortable for running, and fit well without being baggy.	yes
颜值很高但缺点也很明显：我一般穿40的鞋，这次买的40.5的，穿进去鞋子前端大概还有1个大拇指的距离，但是，这并不影响什么。	The shoes are very attractive but the drawbacks are also obvious: I usually wear size 40, but this time I bought 40.5, and there is about a thumb's width of space at the front of the shoe. However, this does not affect anything.	yes
这鞋很“窄”，虽然前面还留着距离，但是感觉紧紧的。	The shoes are quite "narrow", even though there's space in the front, they feel tight.	yes
还有一点，鞋子透气可能不太好，现在穿感觉脚很热。	Another point is that the shoes may not be very breathable, as my feet feel very hot when wearing them now.	yes
压脚背	Putting pressure on the instep	yes
首先鞋子做工很好，值这个价。	First and foremost, the shoes' craftsmanship is excellent, and they are well worth the price.	yes
我的脚是很标准那种，跑鞋uk7.5,eu41.5,皮鞋uk6.5,亚马逊的爱步也买过几双，从来没有出现过不合脚，但是这双我参照评论，买大一号uk7,上脚后因为大了一码长度明显偏长，但因为鞋垫太厚，还是压脚背压的厉害，加上徒步鞋非常硬，导致上脚非常难受。	My feet are quite standard, with running shoes at UK7.5, EU41.5, and leather shoes at UK6.5. I've bought several pairs from Amazon's Aibu, and they've always fit well. However, for this pair, I bought a size larger (UK7) based on the reviews. The shoes were noticeably too long because they were a size too big, but because the insoles were too thick, they still pressed hard on the top of my foot. Combined with the hardness of the walking shoes, they were very uncomfortable to wear.	yes
如果你的脚不是特别瘦那种，不推荐购买这款。	If your feet are not particularly slender, it is not recommended.	yes
如果一定要买，换个鞋垫也能解决，但是原配鞋垫看起来很高级的样子，不用又可惜。	You can change the insole if you have to buy it, but the original insole looks really high-end, so it's a shame not to use it.	yes
非常完美的一次购物！	A perfect shopping experience!	yes
非常满意，非常喜欢，亚马逊海外购都是正品毋庸置疑，质量也非常好，物美价廉，买的放心，售后服务很周到，客服态度都很亲切和蔼，处理问题耐心高效，完美解决后顾之忧，配套的快递送货上门非常便捷稳妥，送货师傅很替顾客着想，每次都会提醒及时从快递柜中取货，感谢亚马逊给顾客提供如此舒适的购物体验。	I am very satisfied and like it very much. There is no doubt that Amazon's overseas purchases are genuine. The quality is also very good, the quality is low, and the purchase is assured. The after-sales service is very thoughtful, the customer service attitude is very kind and kind, the handling of problems is patient and efficient, and the worries are perfectly solved. The supporting express delivery to the door is very convenient and safe. The delivery master is very considerate of customers. He will remind them to pick up the goods from the express cabinet in time every time. Thank you Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.	yes

Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall good?	yes
再说一下包装，就是用保鲜膜包了几层，里面连个包装塑料泡泡纸都没有，打开一看，所有的零件就放在空荡荡的盒子里，还好玩具质量不错，没有坏掉的零件，就是比想象中的小太多了，因为不是带电池的，手推着经常脱轨，感觉轨道两边空隙太大，设计不合理。	Speaking of the packaging, it was just wrapped in a few layers of cling film, without any bubble wrap inside. When I opened it, all the parts were just lying in the empty box. Thankfully, the quality of the toy is good and there were no broken parts. However, it's much smaller than I imagined.

I bought six watches to give to my children, one of which has an incomplete digital display, and the time on all six watches is inconsistent, varying by several hours.	yes
我联系厂家问手表在入库有核对时间吗?他们回复说“有”，既然有，那为啥时间相差那么多，那肯定是手表没有精确度，简单地说就是水货产品，不是我说的难听，看嘛，很明显的质量问题（数字显示不完全）都拿出来卖，是不是垃圾货。	I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watches were checked for the correct time when they were stored. They replied "yes". If so, why is there such a big difference in time? It's clear that the watches are not accurate, simply put, they are inferior products.

很满意的手表	Very pleased with the watch	yes
肯定是正品，去专柜验过货，表的外观很漂亮，做工精细，用料足，加上又是进口机械机芯，所以是有一定的分量的，是那些三四百所谓的机械表不能比的，这个是货真价实的。	It's definitely genuine, I've had it checked at the counter. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the materials are sufficient, and it has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It's incomparable to those so-called mechanical watches that cost three or four hundred. This one is truly worth its price.	yes
表的走时是很准的，误差完全在可接受范围内，表的包装里有珠宝鉴定证书，表盘的12字那里是真钻石，这个自己戴很合适，作为礼品送出去也很有面子。	The watch keeps time very accurately, with errors well within the acceptable range.

It was in stock but not sold directly by Amazon and there was no price increase (which made me secretly happy). However, because it was not sold directly by Amazon, the delivery was slower, and the system showed that the latest expected delivery date would be September 27th.	yes
老婆没手机用难受死了，第二天一早6点多叫我在想想办法，后来上京东一看256G有货可以当天送到，只得立马再订购一台。	My wife was extremely uncomfortable without a mobile phone. She woke me up at 6 o'clock the next morning to figure out a solution.

买来之后其他的都没什么问题，就是在软件连接的时候，怎么都连不上，我家是TP的路由器，上网查了之后发现好多人都有这个问题，弄了两个多小时，各种改路由器的设置，最后我用360WIFI作为媒介给弄好的，期间给小米客服打电话，他们对这个问题也没有什么解决方法，直接就让我联系亚马逊进行售后。	After purchasing, everything else was fine except for the software connection, which just couldn't connect. My home uses a TP router, and after searching online, I found that many people have this problem.

During this time, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have any solutions for this problem and directly told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.	yes
